{"title": "Recently I bought a 20 pound \\'syphon\\' cylinder of liquid CO2 FOOD grade gas from a business on Carolina Beach Road (AirGas?) I carried the cylinder from the business myself and transported it in my own truck. I was charged a HAZMAT fee and when I return the cylinder for refill I am told I will be charged the same HAZMAT fee again. I wrote to a couple of politicians asking who gets this money? No answer. When I have my bulk Propane tank filled I am charged a HAZMAT fee. My question is twofold: Why am I charged for something that doesn\\'t endanger the seller in any way (the CO2)other than being under pressure (just like a can of whipped cream) and WHO is pocketing this HAZMAT fee? To the best of my knowledge the government doesn\\'t mandate it nor do they get a penny of it.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=18905 "}
