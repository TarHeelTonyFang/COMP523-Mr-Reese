{"title": "Summer Rest mystery: On April 2 at 6 p.m. the city planning commission will hold a zoning hearing regarding the 200 block of Beech Road, off Summer Rest, which parallels the Intracoastal just north of Eastwood. That block of Beech Road holds a most mysterious building complex. An ugnly eight-foot-high concrete wall runs over 100 yards at its rear beside the Summer Rest bike trail. A large warehouse with 6 truck bays is just south of the wall, with no ID. The property is surrounded with Do Not Enter signs and electric gates at the entries. Two apparently empty residential complexes flank the property\\'s southern borders, each also with Do Not Enter signs. What\\'s this complex about? What\\'s the rezoning about? Is the city considering tearing down the ugly wall? Thanks.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=21147 "}
