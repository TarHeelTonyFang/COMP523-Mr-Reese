{"title": "Why does Leland Police Department stop and write for violations of stop signs in private communities when it is not legal to do so?\n\n\n\nThese streets are private property and only a handful of traffic laws can be enforced, such as careless and reckless driving and DWI.  Failure to stop at a stop sign and exceeding the posted speed limit are not enforceable.  They are not state maintained streets and the stop signs are not duly erected by the DOT.  I have heard of several people who were cited for such and didn\\'t know to fight it.\n\n\n\nGiven Leland PD\\'s recent history one would expect them to do things by the book...while stopping at a stop sign is always a good idea, these officers need to know the laws they are trying to enforce before they get sued and our taxes increase to pay for their (continued) stupidity.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=19085 "}
