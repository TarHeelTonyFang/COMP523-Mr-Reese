{"title": "Are the city recycling trucks simply dumping their pickup loads at a dump along with the regular trash?  They are now visably just dumping the bins into regular garbage trucks compared to the recycling specific trucks with separated bins that the previous vendor (Waste Mgmt) used to use.  This seems like it would be making separation impossible (i.e. broken glass, etc).
