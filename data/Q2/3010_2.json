{"title": "What is the builder who destroyed Baby\\'s Hospital doing with the half-finished dock in the nearby pond? It was sad enough to see the hospital torn down, and now the pristine pond is also ruined. I\\'m wondering if the town can have the builder finish or remove the eyesore? Who has jurisdiction over that area and for what uses has the property been apporved?
