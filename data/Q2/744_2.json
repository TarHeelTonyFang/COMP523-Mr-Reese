{"title": "Don\u00e4\u00f3\u00bbt need to use my name, naturally, but they paved North College between Laney High School and MLK earlier this year, and along much of the pavement they have not yet installed the reflectors that help tremendously when it is dark and rainy outside. The lines are pretty light also. Just wondering if they are planning to do that anytime soon. Maybe you\u00e4\u00f3\u00bbve already answered and I just haven\u00e4\u00f3\u00bbt seen it. Not a huge deal if they are planning to fix it, a bigger problem if they\u00e4\u00f3\u00bbre just going to leave it.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/2014/10/going-add-reflectors-repaved-section-north-college-road/ "}
