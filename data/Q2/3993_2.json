{"title": "Which driver has the right of way while turning at a traffic signal? \n\nI live on Greenville Loop Rd and often have to go to the intersection with Oleander Dr and Greenville Ave. When I have to turn right at the intersection (heading east towards Bradley Creek) there are drivers who are turning left from Greenville Ave at the same time. I thought they should be yielding to me but they turn in front of me like they have the right of way. Which driver should yield to the other in this instance? And how do we get this enforced?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=13439  "}
