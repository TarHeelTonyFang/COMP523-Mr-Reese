{"title": "Are there any plans to add a bicycle lane along Rogersville Road? (The bicycle traffic along this road has greatly increased with cyclists using it more to get to the cross-city trail on Eastwood from Wrighsville Avenue. The road is narrow and I have seen some near-misses on the curves. Cyclists ride in the middle of the lanes along with cars and this is quite dangerous.)", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=14561  "}
