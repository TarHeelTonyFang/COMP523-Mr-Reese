{"title": "When will there ever be a connection between Route 87 (near South Brunswick Middle School) and Route 211 (near Lowes Home Improvement) by Long Beach Road.  The only access now is to take 87; right on Dosher Cutoff; right on 211 totaling over 15 miles just to get to a grocery store.  What about Brunswick Road near the middle school?  Who owns the land?  Just wondering.  Sure would be nice for easier access.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20100507/ARTICLES/100509719?p=all&tc=pgall Construction is scheduled to start in 2013.
