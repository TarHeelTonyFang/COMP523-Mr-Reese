{"title": "The DOT has justifiably redirected highway 17 in front of Hewitt Burton road neighborhoods, Snee Farm, Stoney Creek and all those that live on Snowfield Road and Highway 87 over the last year or so. I understand the redirection is required in order to maintain traffic flow and build a major intersection of I-140. When will the access road in front of the three or four neighborhoods be complete in both directions. We keep getting notifications of \\traffic Flow change\\\" and it is only 3 days away. I will now be inconvenienced a total of 6-7 miles additional every time I need to travel North on Highway 17 due to the access road only being one direction. Who can I call for more specific timelines and when do they anticipate being \\\"done\\\" and no longer negatively affecting highway 17 by continuously redirecting traffic flow? Please feel free to paraphrase my question or concerns as I acknowledge this question is lengthy and wordy.\"", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=17680 "}
