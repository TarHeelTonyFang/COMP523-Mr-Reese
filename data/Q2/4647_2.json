{"title": "Why is the NHC Sheriff\\'s dept assigning a vehicle to sit all day next at the Agrium entrance on 421 North, just before the Eagle Island Fish Market.  This appears to be a recently reopened industrial entrance and every day for the past week+, there has been a manned sheriff\\'s vehicle with lights flashing sitting next to the entrance.
