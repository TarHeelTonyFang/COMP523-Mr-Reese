{"title": "Why is it taking so long for DirecTV to give this region HD for our local stations?  And, I just recently received a message on screen that WECT, our NBC station, may be cancelled for this area.  What is going on here?  I cannot get a response from DirecTV on either topic.  On screen TV prompt says to go to www.directv.com/alert but the site doesn\\'t allow access.  Isn\\'t anyone else concerned about this?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question.
