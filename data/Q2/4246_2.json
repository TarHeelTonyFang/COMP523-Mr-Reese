{"title": "Why are there no turn signals along the stretch of intersections of Carolina Beach Road and Horn Road, Raye Drive, Silver Lake, etc.  I have seen three accidents there in the past two months.  At the very least, some signage is needed.  Also, at the intersection of Coddington Elementary and Carolina Beach Road...but for different reasons.  Each morning, during my commute, sheriff\\'s officers must direct traffic in and out of the school parking lot, along Carolina Beach Road.  While I believe this is necessary to prevent worse congestion along the stretch of road, it seems that using officers to do this job is not the right answer.
