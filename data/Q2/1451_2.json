{"title": "I was about to ask you a question and got a reply from the Mayor of Oak Island to a diffrent question concerning narcotics that she couldn\\'t answer. Can I ask you two questions?\n\nMy original question was: Early Lighthouses and lanterns used to burn Whale oil. What did Whale oil smell like? Did it smell like hot lard when it burned?\n\nThe second question related to a recent story about a major narcotics bust (in Texas?) where a small single prop plane landed at a small unremarkable airport to refuel. For some reason it was checked and found laden with narcotics. I was wondering if, as KSUT on Oak Island is half way between Miami,or the Bahamas and Buffalo, NY, what precautions are taken to check that aircraft aren\\'t refuelling at KSUT and carrying narcotics to points beyond or even delivering them here? I have heard rumors that KSUT brings narcotics to OI and even that large pleasure craft occasionally sail out of the OI marina to pick up drugs. Please don\\'t mention Mayor Wallace in any reply to this question.\n\nWarmest regards and I repeat again that I always look for your articles.
