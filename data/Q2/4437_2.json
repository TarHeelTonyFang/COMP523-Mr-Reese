{"title": "why does Legion Stadium use fireworks for  so many events?   It must be expensive. The air and noise pollution from fireworks has to be high.The dogs in the neighborhood cower  in fear and  bark from the time it begins until well after it stops.  It has to hurt their ears and be scary. (Imagine living in a war zone with bombs going off)   I can understand fireworks on the 4th of July  but every weekend it gets to be a bit much. Is there an avenue that the dog owning neighbors can use to address this situation.    I am sure our neighbors dont enjoy our barking dogs either.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=14170  "}
