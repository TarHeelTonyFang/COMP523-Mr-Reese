{"title": "I am trying to find out something about the history of the Holiday Inn on\u0152\u00e6Market Street in Wilmington NC. I know that they used to be on the same\u0152\u00e6side of the street as the Ramada Inn. Now they are located a little further\u0152\u00e6down on the other side of the street at 5032 Market street. My question is\u0152\u00e6- What was the name of the business that had the building before they moved\u0152\u00e6in?. Any ideas as to where I might find this info?\u0152\u00e6", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=17665 "}
