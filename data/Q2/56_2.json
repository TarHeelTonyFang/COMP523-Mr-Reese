{"title": "A neighbor has allowed both her home and her yard fall in hideous disrepair. I believe that there is an ordinance that requires her to maintain upkeep. What particular office do I contact? I am the coordinator for MOW\\'s. This happened to one of our clients, after numerous letters, the next step was a lien on the property. The neighbors helped the elderly couple clean up the exterior of the home and yard. I don\\'t know the origin of the letters or who would be placing the lien. I now am on the other side and need help in getting the neighbor to clean up. Thank you.
