{"title": "What are the rules and costs $ for traveling with surfboards out of ILM airport on USAirways or Delta?  Do they not allow surfboards on the smaller airplanes?\n\n\n\nLocally at ILM, the rules seem to apply differently than what\\'s listed on each airline\\'s website.  I know people that have been turned away from their flight out of ILM on Delta because they were traveling with surfboards.  The airline sent them to Raleigh at the last minute and they barely caught their (new) flight.\n\n\n\nI\\'ve also had USAir charge me for EACH surfboard in the board bag, which ended up costing way more than the ticket!
