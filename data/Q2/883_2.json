{"title": "Hi, my parents are both over 75 years old and live on carolina beach road.  Dad just got out of the hospital and wants to go cut fire wood for the upcoming winter.  He uses the fire place for heat.  I am trying to avoid his going out to get firewood and was wondering if there are any services that deliver free fire wood to seniors?????\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=3163 "}
