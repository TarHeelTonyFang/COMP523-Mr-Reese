{"title": "Please tell me how we can get our street fixed?  We are in the Arrondale subdivision and we were never turned over for County maintenance.  Windgate Drive is absolutely hazardous.  All of the Kirkwood subdivision use this main road too.  I don\\'t know where to turn.  We have asked DOT and they say, they cannot do anything.  Some of the potholes are so bad, there have been hubcaps left along the side of the road.  Help us please.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=1770 "}
