Almost as soon as the paving was finished a crew working on underground utilities cut up a section of the road where Jabbertown meets East Leonard Sreet and only filled it back with dirt and rocks. Big trucks making the turn onto Jabbertown from Progress Energy and/or the fertilizer plant will soon pound a huge hole there, causing a dangerous situation for themselves and the public.
