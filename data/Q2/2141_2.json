{"title": "Several weeks ago I was on Market St. and what I believe to be a Navy E-2C appeared to be heading towards ILM for a landing or a touch and go. Today, I saw what appeared to be an E-2C heading north parallel to Market St and flying at a very low altitude. I\\'m curious as to whether E-2C aircraft are flying into and out of ILM and, if so, why and if not, are these aircraft, in fact, E2-C aircraft and what is the reason for them to periodically be flying in the Wilmington area.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=18682 "}
