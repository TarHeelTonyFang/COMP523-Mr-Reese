{"title": "Growing up on the North Side of time  I spent an enormous amount of time at the Community Boy\\'s Club under the guidance and mentoring of the the late Earl \\Papa Jack\\\" Jackson. I distinctly remember a gentleman name \\\"Mr. Blue\\\". I was not even a teenager and Mr. Blue had to be at least 60-65. My question is where was he from? When did he past away and how was he connected to the Community Boy\\'s Club?  One person that may have the answers to these questions is Mr. Adolf Richardson whom I think is still connected witht he Boy\\'s Club.\"", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=4466 "}
