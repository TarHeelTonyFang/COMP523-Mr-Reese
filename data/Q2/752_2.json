{"title": "Due to the increase in traffic on George Anderson Drive when the new developments are built, will a right turn lane be added to the stoplight from Geo. Anderson to Carolina Beach Road?  In the mornings 7:00am to 8:30am there is a long line of traffic to turn right when one car wants to go straight into Echo Farms and has to wait for the light.
