{"title": "I recently saw a 1950-something post card featuring a place called the Blue Top Lodge on Hwy. 17 North of Wilmington, NC.  It appears to be an old Pure Oil Station around which several cabins were built as a motel.  The old station appears to be the office.\n\n\n\nSo, my question is: what is the history of the former Blue Top Lodge on Hwy. 17 north of Wilmington?  \n\n\n\nThanks.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/2015/01/history-old-blue-top-lodge-u-s-17-north-wilmington/ "}
