{"title": "hello, I remember reading a Star News article about Bradley Williams retiring after only 15 years? it was posted June 10 , 2010. it was as follows....\n\nI\n\nn May, the state treasurer department\\'s retirement system sent a letter to Sykes saying Bradley Williams was eligible for retirement and the date he would be retiring, Sykes said.\n\n\n\nIt\\'s unclear how Bradley Williams qualifies for retirement because even though he\\'s spent 15 years in the system, he is too young to qualify for the typical retirement benefits one could earn at or close to retirement age.\n\n\n\nAs of deadline on Thursday, the state\\'s treasurer was unable to locate information about Bradley Williams\\' retirement.\n\n\n\n\n\nCould you tell me if this is common? And could you tell me if anyone found out how he retired at this early age?\n\n\n\nthank you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n", "text": "Hello.
