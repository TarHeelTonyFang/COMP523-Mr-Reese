{"title": "I am wondering why, with unemployment still a problem in New Hanover County, the CEO of NHRMC has refused to rehire any nurses who have left the hospital in the past? Even if the Nurse gave the full month\\'s notice and left on good terms? What is the purpose or reason behind such a decision? And why would New Hanover County Commisioners allow such an outlandish decision to be made by the CEO of a county controlled hospital? Aren\\'t they going to run out of good, trained nurses to work at the hospital? ", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question.
