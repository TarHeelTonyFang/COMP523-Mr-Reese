{"title": "Can you please explain to me why this new pipeline has been put in cutting through the Masonboro Yacht Club and who is responsible for it being put in? The pilings on the left side of the water, heading out towards the ICW have been removed or cut down. The signs for this pipeline are no help letting you know where exactly it is located. The last time we went out, we were nervously trying to navigate the no wake zone and saw a frayed rope floating just below the surface. It appeared to be attached to something under the water but had no buoy attached to the top. It is very dangerous and could cause a lot of damage to someones propeller if it becomes tangled. I also noticed a number of the channel markers in the ICW are missing. Last year there were quite a few buoys and channel markers whose lights were not working. Again, very dangerous when going at a high rate of speed down the ICW at night especially for those not familiar with the water. Who is in charge of the maintenance for the buoy\\'s and channel markers in the ICW? And is anything going to be done about making the Trails End/Masonboro Yacht Club water more navigable? Please help, boating is supposed to be fun and relaxing, not nerve wrecking! Thank you!", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=18674 "}
