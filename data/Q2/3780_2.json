{"title": "When will they installed the signs on George Anderson, Halyburton Park - Bike Path in the proper places. As you exit Halyburton Park at George Anderson there is a pedestrian sign facing the park. For what reason? I believe that this sign belongs on George Anderson in the opposite direction to the one they installed as you drive North. A pedestrian sign is needed to mark the crosswalk as one approaches to the South. The one installed Stop Sign on the bike path is a little ridiculous. Stop Signs on other parts of the trial and smaller and lower to be seen easily.\n\n\n\nAnd something is needed to better mark the traffic island that was installed in the middle of the road. I have noticed similar island being installed along this cross city bike trail, and I believe that more people will begin to complain about this bad design of a traffic island. They are very hard to see under certain conditions.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=8405 "}
