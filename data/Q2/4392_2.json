{"title": "Why do some exit ramps such as the one on 133 going to HWY 17 have two entry points that then merge to one?  It seems this would cause more accidents and conjestion as people are trying to merge from two different areas?!?  \n\n\n\nWhy is there no advance warning about the change on the exit ramp from 133 to Hwy 17?
