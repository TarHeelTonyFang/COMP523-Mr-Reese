{"title": "I am looking some information or histor on the UNCW club football team. Also, do they still play? I started as quarterback and served as the club presdident in 1987. Terry Schappert was my starting wide receiver. I have moved away and serve as senior pastor for Selah Christian church in Wayne county and I only find like two black and white pictures online from the library at UNCW. Thanks in advance for any assistance. I\\'ve coached my son in 10 and under ball and shared some of my stories before I transferred to ECU where I did not start and I\\'d like to show these kids this team was more than my imagination.\n\n\n\nWarm regards and God bless,\n\nPatrick\n\n\n\nRev Patrick Muston, Senior Pastor\n\nSelah Christian Church\n\n", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=15268  "}
