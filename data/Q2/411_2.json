{"title": "Can I opt out of 911 service on a computer fax line that will never be used to dial emergency services?\n\n(I have had a secondary computer line for faxing and never been charged a monthly fee for 911 service since this line is not for voice.  Now New Hanover County wants to start charging a monthly fee.  I do not want to pay for a service I will not use since this line is for data only.  I pay for 911 service on my home and cell phones now and am wondering why they want to charge me for a data only line.  What are my options and whom do I contact to opt out?)", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=19953 "}
