{"title": "Why does TimeWarner Cable black out coverage of all Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals baseball games on all channels it provides, including MLB, TBS, ESPN and all others? The Nats are in first place in the National League East. The Orioles are in second place in the American League East, their best showing since 1997. Both teams aren\\'t far away and many people in Southeast NC have ties to the mid-Atlantic region. But we can\\'t see those teams on TimeWarner cable. DirectTV carries MidAtlanticSportsNetwork, which broadcasts both teams\\' games, but I, for one, can\\'t get DirectTV\\'s signal, owing to trees blocking the satellites\\' beams. I assume MASN, controlled by Orioles\\' owner Peter Angelos, is asking a rate that TimeWarner thinks is too high, and is forcing TimeWarner to black out games by those teams carried by any station in its packages. Is TimeWarner considering taking on MASN, and if not, why not? Who\\'s to blame here, TimeWarner, MASN, or both? What can be done? Help!", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=15027  "}
