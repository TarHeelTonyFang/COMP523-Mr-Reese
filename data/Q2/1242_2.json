{"title": "I have 3 questions:\n\n\n\n1.  What's going on at the intersection of 87 and 133?  Seems to be a lot of clearing.\n\n\n\n2.  The old Bridges on River Rd (also 87/133) seems to be having construction work doing on the building.  Is someone moving in?\n\n\n\n3.  The building(across from Farm Bureau Insurance on 87/133, River Rd) that was occupied by the road construction company for Long Beach Rd seems to have moved out, but there is construction worked being done.  Again is someone moving in?\n\n\n\nThanks for looking into these questions.\n\n\n\n--debi", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/2016/11/is-someone-moving-into-the-building-across-from-farm-bureau-insurance-on-river-road-in-brunswick-county/ "}
