{"title": "My question is regarding the Azalea Festival.  I really enjoy this time of year and I think that it is great that this festival creates an environment that citizens can come together.  However, throughout my lifetime I have noticed that usually (not always) this festival is only catered to one ethnic group of people.  Very rarely are the festival events attractive to the minority population or the diverse culture that makes up the City of Wilmington.  This is also true through the makeup of the festival\\'s committee members.  Not many are of the \\other\\\" persuasion.  I as a citizen of this community would like to see this event more inclusive of ALL the cultures and ethnicities that make up our community. Can the committee seek ideas from locals to improve the attractiveness of the festival?\"", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=18255 "}
