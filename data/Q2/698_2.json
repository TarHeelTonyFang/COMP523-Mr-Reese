{"title": "Does the city or the developers of Autumn Hall plan to build a parking area for the users of the Cross City Trail at the intersection of Eastwood and Rogersville Roads?  This is a very popular area of the trail for short walks or bike rides with no proper place to park.  Users are parking along Eastwood Road during the day or on the old area where a motel used to exist on Autumn Hall property.
