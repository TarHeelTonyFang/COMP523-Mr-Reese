{"title": "Would like to know when the road signs are going to be replaced at Sanders Rd and River Rd. They were knocked down by vechcles and taken away by DOT about a month ago and never replaced. This is a dangerous intersection needs all the signage replaced.\n\n\n\nAnother thing I have noticed that Dr Hickey has secured his policital signs to the DOT sign posts with plastic Tie Wraps I am sure this is against the law and they should be removed immediatly. Thanks", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/2014/10/will-missing-road-signs-sanders-river-roads-replaced/ "}
