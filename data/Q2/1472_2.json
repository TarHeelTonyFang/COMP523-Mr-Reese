{"title": "I was wondering why greenfield lake is no longer being cared for. It supposed to be one of the attractions in the wilmington area yet it looks like a swamp litteraly. If you look at it all you see is the green algie growing on it and no water there. If i was a local or a tourist i would not pay to canoe or even pattle boat in that water.
