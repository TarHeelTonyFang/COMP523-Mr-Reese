{"title": "Hey,\n\nI am trying to find out if the family who owned Shields Ice Cream Parlor in Wilmington and Wrightsville Beach is still located in the area. The reason is i am looking for a shields ice cream sign to put in the house i am moving into in the summer. My husband had saved a small table and 2 booth type chairs from the original shields ice cream parlor and we have fixed a small area in the house and are decorating like the parlor was back when it was open... the house is very unique and has been used for a movie the secret life of bees several years ago and just thought it would be a neat idea to save and add a part of good history to the house please help if you can and thanks alot Tina", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=18153 "}
