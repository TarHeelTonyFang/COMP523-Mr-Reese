No shuttle service between Wilmington and Raleigh-Durham International Airport, currently exists, although a privately operated service is in the discussion stage.   That leaves local cab companies and limousine services to provide rides, which can be pricey. A one-way fare from Wilmington to RDU can average between about $220 to $250, although the fare can be split between several riders.
