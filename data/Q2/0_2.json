  "title": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it a policy of the new owner or is it a new lay-out person? Who made the decision to print the 2 crossword puzzles back to back so that there is no way that 2 people can work them at the same time. There is no way the puzzles can be cut out individually. I am not a newspaper employee and never have been but when I look at the relevant pages I can see no reason for this change in policy. I\\'ll be glad to help you all figure it out, or you can just check back issues of the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
