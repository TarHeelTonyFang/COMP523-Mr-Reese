{"title": "Hi \n\nI Am currently looking into Wilmington private schools for my children. But I went to public schools. Therefore I really don't know how to compare the choices I have\n\n(Looking at all of them but more closely at St Marks and Wilmington Christian Academy)\n\nFor public schools we have at least the EOGs to look and compare with, but I don't have anything to use for the private schools. They all seem to be accredited by different organizations as well. Last time I asked a school about their end of year scores they said o we are in the 90th percentile. But they had nothing to show for it. \n\nAlso, how do I know that if my child attends a private school for his elementary school years that if we decide to go public later that they will not be behind the state curriculum \n\nHELP", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/2016/09/how-can-i-compare-private-schools-and-public-schools/ "}
