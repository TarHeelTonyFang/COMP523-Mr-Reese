{"title": "The recycling material in my entire neighborhood was collected today by a garbage truck, not a recycling truck.  What\\'s up with that??  Why are we asked to recycle and then Wilmington just throws it away with other trash.  Now, there were seperate trucks, but, the recycling truck was just a normal back-loader trash truck...not one of those side-loader \\normal\\\" recycling trucks.  Just wondering...Thanks.
