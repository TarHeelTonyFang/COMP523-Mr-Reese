{"title": "A recent article highlighted for all to see was on the robotic teams throughout the areas.  I found it sad that the students needed to combine with other schools and that the days they worked on the project were limited. The F.I.R.S.T. Program is phenomenal, a wonderful opportunity for boys and girls to explore engineering, software design, CAD, etc. while in a competitive environment.  Kudos to the kids and mentors! But, why doesn\\'t every school have the funds to support this program? Where I taught, the kids involved spent almost everyday after school, evenings and Saturdays of the 6-8 week period allowed to create, make and test their robot. They cannot be successful in this program without full support of the schools and communities.  Could you investigate why lottery monies aren\\'t used for this and other creative programs?  There is also a national Lego program for middle school students. Do any of our schools participate in that?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=21031 "}
