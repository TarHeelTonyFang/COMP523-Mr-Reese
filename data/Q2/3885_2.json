{"title": "Where did Military Cutoff get its name?", "text": "Hello. Here's your answer: Military Cutoff Road was built during World War II to facilitate troops and material getting to and from the Port of Wilmington, which itself was quickly ramped up to supply the war effort.  The roadway allowed convoys of troops from Camp Lejune, Camp Davis and other newly formed military bases to avoid travel through Wilmington on Market Street and other city streets to reach the port. Military Cutoff linked Ogden, which was little more than a crossroads back then, with Oleander Drive and Wrightsville Avenue, which connected Wrighstville Beach and Wilmington. "}
