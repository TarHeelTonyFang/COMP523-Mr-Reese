{"title": "I am very pleased that the southern leg of the I140 bypass from 74/76 to Route 17 has finally been completed. However, my concern is regarding the signage heading East on 74/76. There is a sign on the right shoulder indicating that the entrance to the bypass to 17 south is 1/4 mile. The problem is that the sign is almost at the same location as the beginning of the left hand merge lane that takes you to the bypass. There is apparently a left turn allowed at the intersection of 74/76 and the entrance lane. This means that vehicles can enter the bypass either on the left merge lane or directly from 74/76 which seems extremely dangerous.\n\nI contacted the NCDOT via email several weeks ago but never received a response. Maybe you can find out what is going on and get some new signage put in place.\n\nThank you\n\n\n\nGeorge Rosica\n\nLeland", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/2015/01/will-new-signage-ease-confusion-140-u-s-74-76/ "}
