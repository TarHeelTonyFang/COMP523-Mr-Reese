{"title": "Does the highway department have any plans to revise the intersection of Hwy 421 and Golden Rd.?  I have seen numerous near misses and it is confusing to drivers.  Southbound Hwy 421 drivers making u-turns seem confused about who has right of way.  Drivers get caught in the middle of the intersection and add further confusion.  There is already a stop light at Ashley school that permits much safer u-turns.  Other drivers go from the Food Lion center all the way across Hwy 421 to Golden Rd.  Believe me the intersection is more complicated/dangerous than this description.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question.
