{"title": "Very near the new Westgate Nature Park in Leland, there is a road that runs just east of the Wal-Mart that intersects West Gate Drive. Although not named on most online maps, this road is identified as Ocean Gate on the park plan online and on site. There is no stop sign at any point at that intersection. As a first-time visitor to the park I had a near collision this past weekend, and when I looked into what happened, I saw that neither I nor the other driver has a stop sign. As a former deputy sheriff I realized this is an incredibly dangerous situation and immediately called 911. There response was that there used to be a stop sign, but it was taken down. Not satisified, I emailed the city, but have had no response.  ", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=18160 "}
