{"title": "What rules govern automotive repair shops and dealerships using neighborhood streets to test drive vehicles well above the posted speed limits at all times of the day including school hours?  (I live in the city limits and it is an increasing concern that both Britt Motorsports and Tony\\'s Foreign Car Repair are using neighborhood streets near their businesses rather than Market Street to test drive cars and motorcycles\n\nwell above the posted speed limits of 25mph and during school hours.
