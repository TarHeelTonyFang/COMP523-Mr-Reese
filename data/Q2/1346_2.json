{"title": "I live on a county, residential street.  (Particularly Holland Drive, but I think this inquiry is applicable to the entirety of the Wrightsboro community.)  Not once this year have the right-away, or ditch banks been mowed.  Many residents take it upon themselves to do this; many do not.  I suspect the economy and the county budget plays into this decision.  However, this has become more than an eyesore.  It\\'s about drainage, safety, and liability.  Who should I contact?  If individual property owners are responsible, (especially for ditches), do I contact the police?\n\n\n\nThank you,", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=16552 "}
