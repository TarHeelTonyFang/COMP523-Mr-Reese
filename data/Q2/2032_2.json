{"title": "North Brunswick High and North Brunswick Middle both now have over 1000 students each (a total of over 2,000). There are only two possible routes to leave the schools yet one of the directions (taking Old Fayetteville Road to Lanvale Road) does not have a stop light. In theory, half of the students, parents, and buses would be taking this direction. oth schools let out within 10 minutes of each other. Sometimes a police man is there at the intersection to direct traffic, but not always (probably less than 25% of the time. How can NCDOT justify this dangerous crossing for students, parents, and buses not having a stop light? Sometimes buses turning left have to wait 10 minutes to finally make the turn, backing up traffic and leading people to make the dangerous decision to cross with high speed traffic approaching.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/2016/06/why-isnt-there-a-traffic-light-at-old-fayetteville-road-where-drivers-leave-north-brunswick-high-and-middle-schools/ I have also forwarded it to the local news editor in charge of Brunswick County.
