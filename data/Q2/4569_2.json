{"title": "Why haven\\'t workers returned to the Gordon Road re-pavement project to finish their work yet?  It was repaved in the Fall, and some markings have been permanently repainted, but others (i.e., stop lines, etc.) on the side streets intersecting with Gordon have not been permanently repainted. Not that it matters to most drivers anyway, as most completely ignore the stop lines, but it would be nice to see the project finally finished.\n\n\n\nThanks.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=20668 "}
