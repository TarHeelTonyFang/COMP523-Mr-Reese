{"title": "I have asked the same question to you guys three times and still have not an answer! Are you going to do what you have promised or what? \n\n The question is----How can security officers in the afternoon enforce North Carolina Traffic Laws when they are not sworn officers in the state of North Carolina to do so on US 421 North in front of the Sutton Coal Plant? Only Police Officers, Sheriff\\'s Deputies, Campus Police and Special Police Officers sworn via the Sheriff\\'s Standards and the Criminal Standards are allowed to enforce laws. What these guys are doing is illegal!\n\n Please contact me for this response. This is the last time that I will ask. If you don\\'t respond then I will know that this action line is a farce.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=18829 "}
