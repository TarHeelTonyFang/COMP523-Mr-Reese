{"title": "Your today column had a question about I 74. Every time I travel to Charlotte I have the same question. How can it be Interstate 74 when East West Interstate highways are even numbered with lowest number in the South and Highest in the North. I 20 is South of I 74 and I 40 is North, so is should be numbered somewhere between 20 & 40 not 74. It does run with US 74 but it can not be I 74. Why is it called I 74 instead of I 26 or 30?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=17859 "}
