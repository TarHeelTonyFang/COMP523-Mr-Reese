{"title": "Why doesn\\'t the Fort Fisher Recreation Area pro-rate the annual 4X4 fee of $40? I called them last week to inquire on the charges for beach access. I was told it is $10 per day or $40 per calender year!\n\n\n\n2nd question: Why doesn\\'t Fort Fisher State Park open the boat ramp in order for the State to have some income while waiting for more funds to finish it\\'s renovation? The basin appears to have been dredged. They have a number of Park Rangers as well as maintenance personnel on the pay roll with little income this time of year from camp sites. Now that it is fishing season they could have income from the boat ramp also.  ", "text": "Hello. There are no plans to open the boat ramp until renovations are completed in the spring of 2010.
