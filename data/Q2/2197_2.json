{"title": "The city sign ordinance used to prohibit political signage over 12 square feet in size.  The county - outside the city limits - limit was 32 SF. There are quite a few oversized signs inside the city limits and nothing is being done. Why do we have an ordinance if it isn\\'t being enforced?  Shouldn\\'t the city repeal this impotent \\law\\\"?\"", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question.   http://www.myreporter.com/?p=12799 Specifically: Businesses in the 1998 annexation area were notified in 2005 that their signs were out of compliance with the city standards, which means they were either too big, too close to the road or both.  In 2011, the owners signed a compliance agreement with the city, granting them an extension until September 2012.  "}
