{"title": "I see that the city is in the process of expanding independance blvd and is putting up new stop lights on brnad new poles. \n\n\n\nBut i noticed that they are still stringing them across the road by runnign wire across on all these brnad new metal poles and why  they are not helping clean the city up and get rid of the power lines that string across the road and put them on the metal arms like they did at many other intersections on shipyard blvd when they were working on it or like on writsville ave were they finishing up the costruction. \n\n\n\nI like to know why this is happening because it seems that it less cost effective because a hurricane or a storm comes through they are more liabile to fall and break and then you have to replace the light and the lines. \n\n\n\n", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=7640 "}
