{"title": "While walking my dog along Snows Cut path in CB Sunday April 12 mid-afternoon I saw two large black sailing ships go by. They looked like historic replicas.   I believe they were 3-masters but were not under sail.  Any idea what these were?  I have a picture taken from a distance if you would like to see it.  Thank you.
