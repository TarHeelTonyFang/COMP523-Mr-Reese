{"title": "Is panhandling illegal in Wilmington and/or New Hanover County? If approached by a panhandler, should one call the police or just ignore the panhandler and leave if I don\\'t want to donate money to him? Why am I asking? I\\'ve been approached at least three times recently by a panhandler at local Taco Bell restaurants. Two or three times the panhandler approached me as I was leaving the Taco Bell and another time he entered the Taco Bell and asked me for a handout and also asked another customer for a handout. Every time, he was very polite and each time he had a convoluted story that (to me) didn\\'t make sense and didn\\'t appear dangerous but, to me, it still makes me uncomfortable. Apologies for being prolix. ", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. It's illegal downtown, but not in other areas of the city. http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20060323/COLUMNIST02/60323007 "}
