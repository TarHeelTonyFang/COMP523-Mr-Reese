{"title": "Why are the transit bus stops located in dangerous areas in Wilmington? For instance, on Dawson, right before you get to 16th street, the bus stop is actually in a turning lane. Also the ones on 17th street near the hospital. I have witnessed so many \\near wrecks\\\" because the busses take up the cars space and leave the car nowhere to go except in the next person\\'s lane. There are enough accidents in Wilmington without this added danger. Did anyone put any thought about safety into where these stops were designated? ?\"", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=20189 "}
