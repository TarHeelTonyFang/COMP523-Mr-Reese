{"title": "I am not being paid correctly for the two companies and one pay check amd no over-time compensation I (don\\'t) receive. Why does The North Carolina Department of Labor force employees to disclose full personal information in order to accept a complaint? Why can\\'t the employee provide documentation about what is happening and the business profile anonymously? There is not one sane person who would go on record to turn in their employeer. NC is a right to work state and an employeer can termonate your position at any time without justification. Turning in a former or current employer wuld certainly result in the termination of my job? Why would an agency meant to protect us, prevent us from filing a complaint?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=15980 "}
