{"title": "Does New Hanover County offer a renewable energy loan program with regard to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u0152_ 153A-455 - N.C. Gen. Stat. \u0152_ 160A-459.1 and/or HB 1829? These would allow for the installation of renewable energy sources in NHC, with repayment agreements deriving from net energy generated.\n\n\n\nThe county would get the loan repaid without default + 8% interest, because loan repayment would take place before profits were paid to the generator. The homeowner gets a subsidized solar system, which once the loan is repaid, produces a profit. Progress Energy has a brand-new source of clean energy to sell to consumers. And North Carolina flips, one-by-one residences from being net consumers to net generators.  \n\n\n\n... and if not, can we get one?\n\n\n\nLinks to those specific bills:\n\nhttp://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=NC76F&re=1&ee=1", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=14141  "}
