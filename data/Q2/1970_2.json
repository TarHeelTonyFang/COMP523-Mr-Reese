{"title": "Just wondering-who decided it was a good idea to place cones reserving spaces for City Council members on the night of July 4th in the Thalian Hall parking lot? Spaces remained empty  while theatre goers struggled to find parking.  And of course most of the spaces were taken hours before performance time by people not attending the Thalian Hall event.  When there is a scheduled event, the lot parking should be reserved for those attending, don\\'t you think? Yes, even on the 4th of July!", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=14579  "}
