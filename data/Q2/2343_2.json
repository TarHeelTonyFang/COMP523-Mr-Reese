{"title": "This is concerning the question about the gratuity that is added in on your bill.  We went to a local restaurant here in Wilmington (Hiro\\'s) that added the gratuity on to your bill if you were in a group of 6 or more.  If you sit at their tables your are sitting in a group of 6 or more.  My husband and I were sitting at table with a group of strangers.  We still got charged with gratuity.  Are we required to pay what they had on the bill.  We did pay it but not more than that amount.  They would have made more on the tip but it did not seem right the way they did it so they were paid what they stated and not more.  The next time we went we received the worst service we have ever received anywhere before.  And again they put in the required gratuity.  We did not fill this was right.  The service was dreadful.  In such a situation are you required to pay it?  Remember we are not in a large group.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=7246# "}
