{"title": "As an avid Disc Golfer and part of the Disc Golf Community, I\\'ve been patiently waiting for Arrowhead Park to open and to play the new 18 hole Disc Golf Course.  I called the Park\\'s Department several times and was told they would open in April, 2012.  Then I was told May, 2012.  Here we are in June and absolutely no updates.  Could you please help us find out why this park is so far behind schedule?  ", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=14182  "}
