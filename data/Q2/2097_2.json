{"title": "Please look into the curve at Masonboro Loop Rd and Pinegroove Rd in Wilmington, NC. This is the second time a vehicle has landed in my neighbors yard. This past time crashing into the bedroom. The details are available on any of our news outlets. We need to slow the speed limit down and a guard rail if the curve cannot be adjusted.
