{"title": "With the addition of CBS programming to WWAY TV in January there was no mention whether or not Cozi TV programming would continue.  Cozi is one of my favorite channels so I'm wondering if WWAY would be capable of supporting Cozi on a fourth channel since ABC, CBS, and the CW would be on it's current channel lineup. If they plan to drop Cozi would WILM consider adding it since they are losing CBS in the switch?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/2016/09/will-wway-continue-to-carry-cozitv-or-will-wilm-add-it/ "}
