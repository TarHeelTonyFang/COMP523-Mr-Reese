{"title": "What are the planes that are constantly circling back and forth over the Monkey Junction area at night? They usually have red and white flashing lights on them. This happens pretty often, and I have been watching them for years now do this over my house (I have video!) By the light of the moon sometimes (they also start it at sunset as well) you can really tell they are spraying something. They make these long lines of clouds that stay there for a very long time. It can be 3 or 4 planes at a time just going back and forth. Military Exercise or not I think the people should at least be allowed to know what it is that they are spraying or releasing into the air, as it is certainly being let out A WHOLE LOT!!!
