{"title": "Is their an ordinance within New Hanover County as  to what time Trash Service may begin?  People who reside in New Hanover Co all have private trash services. In our subdivision everyone has a different provider. All but one trash hauler comes at a respectable time.  My neighbor\\'s trash hauler comes weekly on Friday mornings, for the past month, they have arrived no later than 3:00am, waking up neighbors who must get up and go to work. The trucks are noisy, you can hear employees talking and they back down the street to avoid turning around! What\\'s wrong with no earlier than 6:00am?  With budget issues for the county (New Hanover)wouldn\\'t it be smarter if New Hanover County had the same trash services assigned to local areas to save wear and tear on our streets? Our subdivision has at least four different providers for the area!", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=9816 "}
