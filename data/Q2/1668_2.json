{"title": "Is it legal for a cop to give me a reckless driving charge or even a citation for impeding traffic for going to slow on a 50cc moped. For instance if the speed limit is posted 40 and I\\'m doing 20mph still accelerating? Or if it is posted 55 and I\\'m doing 30mph. I have been talked to like crap and given two citations by two separate cops for these exact situations, and in less than two weeks apart from each other. I feel that they are just harassing mopeds and scooters. I feel this is a problem with the police department and should be dealt with if it is not illegal for me to do so. I doubt I am the only one this has happened to. ", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=15360  "}
