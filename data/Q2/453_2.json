{"title": "Can you inform me, regarding several construction projects under construction in the Wilmington area. For example, the cross city trail have signs along the proposed route stating that this project is being funded by The America Reinvestment and Recovery Act, which is Federal money. I believe we passed a Parks Bond Bill awhile back that was supposed to pay for the project. If both are true, where is the Park Bond Money?  Randall Parkway is another project that is being funded by the same fund. Where\\'s the money that was set aside before for this project? Please info this uninformed person. Is Empie Park federal money also. Got to love that Park Bond. Don\\'t spend a cent, just take and hide.\n\n\n\n", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=6563 "}
