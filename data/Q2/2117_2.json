{"title": "Recently I read an article in your paper, where a police horse had been bitten by a dog. The owner was charged with a criminal offence.  \n\n\n\nTwo months ago, myself and my dog were bitten by an unleashed dog with no rabies vaccination.It was a long nine days to see if I had rabies and the medical bills really weren\\'t in the budget. I was told all the action I could take would be in civil court.\n\n\n\nMy question is:\n\n\n\nWhy when a dog bites a police horse the owner of the dog was charged with a criminal offence, but when a dog bit me, a person, nothing happened?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nPatrick Sweeney\n\n910 512 0002", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=18351 "}
