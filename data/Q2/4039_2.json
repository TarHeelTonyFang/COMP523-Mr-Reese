{"title": "Who do I send a complaint to about the traffic light cameras? I just got two tickets for running a red light on Dawson when I know the light just turned yellow on the first and the second I was stopped at the white line. After I stopped at the white line I saw the camera flash go off AFTER I was stopped and just sitting there. No other car was at the light.   Have others been complaining about this problem?  What can be done?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=17463 "}
