{"title": "Are there any plans by the Department of Transportation to revamp the dangerous turn off of River Road onto Sanders Road? \n\nI recommend putting a long turning lane on River Road for those traveling southbound who want to turn onto Sanders Road and taking out the dangerous and confusing median. I also recommend a sign for those coming from the beach who want to turn onto Sanders to use their turn signal.  \n\nPresently, those coming from the beach or northbound exit onto Sanders at 55 mph onto a 45 mph road with a subdivision exit shortly after... not to mention 35 mph when school is in at Bellamy. If those traveling northbound even bother to signal that is, making those caught waiting to turn onto Sanders in the dangerous section of road that is in the median not sure when to actually proceed.  If someone is already in the weird little section of the median to turn onto Sanders then those waiting to take their spot risk being hit from behind by the southbound traffic traveling 55 mph around a corner. Also, at night...you really need to know when to turn as the paint of the median does not really help so some further signage would be beneficial.
