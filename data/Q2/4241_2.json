{"title": "Why are there no signs reminding people to turn on their lights when it rains??? You would think it would be common sense but it just isn\\'t happening. Wake up people: it\\'s the law.

They are gone before I can even see them.\n\nDebra", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=8269 "}
