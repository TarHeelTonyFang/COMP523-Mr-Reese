{"title": "There are lots of sports bars in the area. Is there one that caters to Dallas Cowboy football?", "text": "Hello. I asked Dan Spears, our sports editor, who said he knew of no bars that specifically catered to Dallas fans, but here's what he also said: If you're a cowboys fan, you can pretty much find any bar in the city, and you'll be ok :)   well, not the Copper Penny (Eagles bar) or Ten Pin Alley (Steelers).   I would suggest either of the Buffalo Wild Wings (north end of Van Campen), south end on Carolina Beach Road just south of monkey junction. Also, Old Chicago on Market Street. But be advised to get there early. Bars open at noon on Sundays, normally, and fill up quickly on NFL days. Regards, Vaughn Hagerty MyReporte.com staff"}
