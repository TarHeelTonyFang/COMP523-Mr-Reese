{"title": "During WW11, did they build concrete floatable drydocks somewhere north of the railraod bridge on the NE River?\n\nIt seems that I saw one being towed down the river. I also heard that a liberty ship was torpedoed, but still afloat just off the coast and one of these drydocks was moved into positon for a salvage operation.\n\nI also heard that these drydocks were used in the Normandy landing to make portable docks.\n\n\n\nIs there any truth to these stories?\n\n", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question.
