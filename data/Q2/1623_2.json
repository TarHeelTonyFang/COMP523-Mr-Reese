{"title": "Inquiry on first question several weeks ago.\n\n I asked if the water authority ever calibrated the meters they use to measure our water consumption. \n\nAll scales and meters on commercial ventures in NC require annual calibrations because they charge for the product either by the gallon or pound.\n\nDoes the Water Authority also fall in this catagory? \n\nAnd why not?\n\nCan I ask for a meter calibration? and if they overcharge for water, can we sue to get a rebate or reduction in price. \n\nThank you, ", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=8829 "}
