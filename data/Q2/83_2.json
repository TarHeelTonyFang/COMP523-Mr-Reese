{"title": "Airlie Road is truly a gem in Wilmington- so serene and beautiful.\n\nHowever, one thing is destroying this Wilmington landmark- high-speed traffic. The speed limit is 35 MPH all the way to the curve where Airlie Road then parallels the ICW- where the speed limit drops to 25 MPH.  Additionally, there are signs posted that cyclists may use the full lane- and this road is HEAVILY used by cyclists.\n\nThe 35 MPH speed limit is not compatable with neither the serenity of Airlie Road, nor the cyclists.  Most cars- most- exceed the 35 MPH limit.  A dangerous mix with cyclists, and also hazardous with the entrances to Airlie Gardens and the Church on the corner.  And of course, the noise of speeding cars is drowning out the sounds of nature along Airlie Road.\n\nWhy is the speed limit 35 MPH, and not 25 MPH for the full length of Airlie Road(like the stretch along the ICW)?  How does one go about getting a speed limit changed in Wilmington?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=14465  "}
