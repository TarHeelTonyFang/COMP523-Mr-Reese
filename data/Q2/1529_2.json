{"title": "If a motorcycle shop on Market Street allows customers and staff to test drive its cycles on residential streets in my neighborhood well above the posted speed limit of 25mph, often without helmets, and causes unnecessary noise in an otherwise quiet area, who do I contact in city government to file a complaint?\n\n(The shop is located in the old Britts building at the corner of Market Street and Edwards Street.  Rather than use Business 17, owners are using Edwards, Saint Nicholas and Green Meadows Drive in a quiet residential neighborhood all times of the day to test drive bikes.  Those of us who work shift work are unable to sleep due to excessive noise from the bikes and are concerned about the speeding by these reckless operators.\n\nThis building used to house a gym, now is has become a nuisence. How do we stop this and make them use Market Street to test drive their bikes?)", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/2012/10/are-there-laws-against-businesses-test-driving-speeding-vehicles-in-neighborhoods/ "}
