{"title": "Why is gas so much cheaper near the hospital than any other place in the city?\n\nGoGas is 3.51 there as is Wilco Hess CB Rd and Wellington.\n\nYet you go to Market st and Wilco is 20 cents higher as is BP and all the others. Is price gouging going on within the city?\n\nIt makes no sense when the same brand of gas is selling 20 to 23 cents/gallon cheaper by the hospital than anywhere else in the city.\n\nThanks", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=3214  "}
