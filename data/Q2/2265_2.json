{"title": "The traffic signal on MLK east bound turning left on Kerr Avenue is extremely backlit by the bright sun between 7am and 730am.  Obviously this will change as the season and time changes, but it is very dangerous during school travel times.  A school bus was as the front of the line and could not tell when the light was green or when it turns red because the sun is so bright directly behind the signal.  Can the city install black deflectors around the stop light to help make it easier and safer to see the signal?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=8036 "}
