{"title": "Why was the police at a home on Murrayville Road on November 4th.  They had the whole home taped off and had the crime vehicle, ambulance, and detectives out.  Then we saw more police at the entrance of Courtney Pines.  It appeared that there had been a death and they were looking for somebody.  Later on we heard the police helicopter and all of the dogs in the neighborhood was barking.  We have not seen anything on the news or newspapers.  For the public safety when something likes this happens it would be nice to be informed so we can take extra precautions.", "text": "Hello. Thanks for contacting us. There was a death at that location, but it turned out to be a suicide. Routinely, we don't report suicides as news. "}
