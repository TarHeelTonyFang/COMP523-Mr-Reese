{"title": "Can something not be done to help with the traffic congestion on Holly Tree Rd in the afternoons when school is over for the day????   Traffic waiting to go into the school backs up to the assisted living facility and traffic has to go around them in the center lane which is disignated for turning only.  Then when you get to the intersection of the road going into the school traffic in the on coming direction are in the turn lane to go to the school also.  I have nearly been hit head on a couple of times becuase of this. Why doesnt the city do sometthing to the intersection like they do other places like Holy Tree / Pine Grove Rd and also future plans to re do the intersection of Pine Grove / Masonboro Loop / Masonboro Sound Rd.\n\n\n\n", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=8160 "}
