{"title": "Hello.  In Nov 2014, there were signs along Greenville Loop Rd and Masonboro Loop Rd  depicting proposed bike/jogging trails as part of a 2014 Transportation Bond.  I recall that the bond passed, and I supported the bond because of these signs.  I have seen no action whatsoever on these trails or the 2 traffic circles that were also advertised.  (I have pictures of the signs if you would like them.)  Can you find out what happened to this proposal?  Are they still planning these items, or did I get hood-winked and the money went to something else, like more Michigan U-turns? (that I would never vote for!)  Any information you could provide would be appreciated.  Thank you!", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/2017/02/whats-the-progress-on-the-2014-transportation-bond-projects/ "}
