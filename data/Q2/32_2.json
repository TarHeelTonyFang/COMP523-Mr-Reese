{"title": " What is the problem with the Cape Fear Memorial bridge on the westbound lanes at the transition form the pavement to the grating. The grating is 1 1/2 to 2 inches higher than the pavement and every time you cross it you get a resounding thud.\n\nThe bridge is just not sitting level.\n\nCannot be good for my suspension much less the damage it is doing to my tires.
