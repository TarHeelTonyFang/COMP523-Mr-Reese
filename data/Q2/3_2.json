{"title": "     I have a watercolor af a portrait of Albert Einstein done by A Carlos Hidalgo which he gave to me as a gift In Rome Italy in either 1968 or 69. I would like to have it appraised but it has been in a shipping tube since it was given to me.  Do you think it has deteriorated and should I have a professional remove it as I am thinking of having it framed and appraised.  I greatly appreciate any help or suggestions you may give me. Thank you very much", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question.
