{"title": "I heard a disturbing about Williston Junior High involving an AIG algebra teacher. He started the year off saying that each student started off with a \\B\\\" and that the only way to achieve an \\\"A\\\" was to complete extra credit. He said even if you score 100 on all exams and complete everything else required you would still only receive a B letter grade without performing extra credit.  This seems highly irregular and I was wondering if this common or even allowed?\"", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=19183 "}
