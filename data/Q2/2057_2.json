{"title": "On 17th street, between College Rd and St. Andrews, there is a traffic pattern that causes close-calls almost daily.  It is 17th street directly in front of Scotchman and Bruster\\'s.  Some cars turn left into Scotchman off of 17th and a lot make a u-turn.  At the same time there are cars at a stop sign coming out of Scotchman, making the right turn onto 17th.  The cars at the stop sign do not yield to the u-turning cars.  It ends up with both cars nose-to-nose trying to figure out who should go, while traffic off of college approaches quickly.  To be honest, I am not even 100% certain that the u-turning vehicles have the right of way.  Seems simple to just put up a no u-turn sign, to force u-turning cars to do so 150 ft later at College Rd, no?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=16209 "}
