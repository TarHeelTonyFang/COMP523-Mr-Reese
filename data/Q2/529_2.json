{"title": "Did German U Boat sailors see a movie in Southport during WW II?\n\n\n\nA friend of mine swears that during World War II several German sailors from a U Boat off Southport were able to come ashore undetected and go see a movie playing at the cinema in Southport.\n\nHe says he has heard others tell the same story and that it really happened.\n\nI know U Boats were active off the NC coast and several were sunk but this seems a little far fetched. Anyone else hear this story? \n\nCould they be mistakenly be referring to German POWs who might have been allowed to see a movie for good behavior or such?\n\n", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=8327   "}
