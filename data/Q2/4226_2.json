{"title": "Why are there no bicycle racks at Legion Stadium anywhere?  There are none at the pool there either. I live about 6 blocks from there and wanted to go see a football game. Since I\\'m disabled and don\\'t drive a car I use an electric motor assisted trike for my transportation. I couldn\\'t stay and watch the game because there was no place that would have been safe to lock my trike to. That is a bit silly for a place that wants people to come there especially since they don\\'t have enough car parking anytime something really popular is going on. Who would I have to talk to go get something done about this?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=20154 "}
