{"title": "When you drive around pretty much anywhere in Wilmington, you can\\'t help but notice advertising road signs for businesses, work at home programs, lose weight fast now schemes, etc etc. Honestly, I feel like these signs are really making our roads look trashy. Is is legal to put signs out anywhere that you want to? Shouldn\\'t there be some kind of regulation in place? Imagine if everybody started putting signs out for whatever reason they saw fit?

Is it legal to remove such signs if they are on public/city/county property? ", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=5815  "}
