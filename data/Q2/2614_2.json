{"title": "What does the Wilmington Code Enforcement have to say about mold growing in a rented apartment? Is the landlord responsible for sending out a mold expert to determine what type of mold is growing, for the safety & health of their tenant and their pets ?( and to keep it from spreading into another home, if moving is necessary) What are my rights as a tenant regarding having a safe & healthy place to stay until the issue is resolved, or another apartment is provided for tenant on lease? What about the cleaning expense/ damage incurred to personal property/and any doctor bills & veterinary expenses incurred  due to the mold issue? When does this become a legal issue? And finally, what are the time limits for tenants exposed to mold, in regards to the landord providing resolution to mold problems? Thank you in advance for any helpful answers.
