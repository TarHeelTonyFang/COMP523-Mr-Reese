{"title": "There is a very large apology in the Sunday paper from P&W Waste Oil. Seems like they have been dumping PCBs somewhere in the area.The sin of omission is that it does not specify where the dumping occurred. I have noticed a trail of chemical on Carolina Beach Road from Shipyard to Raleigh Street going back into Landmark Industrial Park. Other controlled spills have shown up on Independence Blvd between 17th & Carolina Beach Road.\n\nThere are many unscrupulous ways to dispose of toxic materials. What did they do. Also how dangerous are PCBs? We need to be reminded for our safety and protection. How dangerous is this situation? $19,000,000.00 fine? Must be pretty serious.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20130715/articles/130719769#gsc.tab=0 "}
