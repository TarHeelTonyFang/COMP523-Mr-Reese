{"title": "On a recent visit to Wilmington my husband and I were walking down toward the river after visiting the Cotton Exchange.  There was a large fenced in area and the fence was covered with keys...hundreds and hundreds of them.  I would love to know the significance of this. It might have been Chestnut Street but I\\'m not sure.  Any ideas?\n\nThank you.\n\nMarie Gill", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20091223/ARTICLES/912239986  "}
