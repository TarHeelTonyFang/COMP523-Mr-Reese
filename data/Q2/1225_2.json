{"title": "I don\\'t know if you want to post this, but if you feel you must be my guest.\n\n\n\nI am doing a search for my maternal family and have traced them from Austria to London, England to New York. However, my mother when she was alive, always spoke of having a cousin who was the sheriff in Wilmington, NC. This was probably in the 40\\'s or 50\\'s. She said his wife\\'s name was Nettie I think. I\\'m not sure of the last name. Can you help me please? You can email me if you\\'d like. I would prefer that, but you can also post here.. :)\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\nLynn Lawson colorfulpaints@hotmail.com\n\n", "text": "Hello. I'm sorry we can't do individual genealogical research. If you have general questions about how to find family records or whatever, we could probably point you toward some resources. "}
