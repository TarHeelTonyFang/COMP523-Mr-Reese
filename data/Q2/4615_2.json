{"title": "Why is no one doing anything about the unsafe driving around Pine Valley Elementary School. The parents are rediculous and set a poor example for their children. They park any way they want and any place they want. They ignore all no parking signs. They enter the bus area where is says do not enter. They park in all directions.They make u turns and block traffic. They drive down sidewalks and almost hit people. They pass buses waiting to enter the drop off area. They drive in the grassy areas almost hitting people walking on the sidewalks. They have no respect for the neighborhood residents or their property. They sit in the residents driveways or constantly use them for their turn around instead of going down the street. They criss cross the roads to illegally park. They speed and ignore the school crossing guard. No one is enforcing the city\\'s parking ordinance at all. Every time someone from the city or the school comes out the problem seems less so they don\\'t get the full view. Why do so many of them drive? They let their kids off anywhere instead of waiting in the car line. People walking cross the street all over the place instead of using the crosswalks. You need to spend a couple days under cover and see for yourself- it is amazing what some of these people do-they have absolutely no concern for any children or safety.
