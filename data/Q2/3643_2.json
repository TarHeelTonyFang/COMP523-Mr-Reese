{"title": "When local politicians violate state laws, as the mayor and city council did in the Monkey Junction annexation meetings by intentionally not allowing all affected to be heard, what is my remedy as a resident of the city?  Can they be charged, or arrested?  Does the District Attorney or the States Attorney need to be contacted?  What remedy do the citizens have for the violation of these laws, other than elections.  Do I have to file a lawsuit?", "text": "Hello. Here's your answer: Of course, the voting booth is always a great way for voters to punish politicians for their actions. It happens all the time. But the remedy or punishment for a violation of the law by the mayor and city council depends on exactly what law you believe was broken. If an elected official took a bribe, for example, that could be a criminal offense and a call to the district attorney might be appropriate. The office of Ben David, district attorney for New Hanover and Pender counties, can be reached at 341-1400. But violations of laws such as open meetings or public records laws all have specific remedies. With regard to the Monkey Junction annexation, the appropriate remedy would be a legal challenge filed in Superior Court. One group of property owners in the Monkey Junction area has already done that. They got an attorney, Jim Eldridge, and he filed a suit on their behalf. "}
