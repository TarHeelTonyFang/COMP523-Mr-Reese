{"title": "Hello!\n\n  I am a UNCW Graduate student and spend a good amount of time on College Rd.  At the intersection of College Rd. and Wrightsville Ave, heading west away from the beach, traffic gets terribly backed up, and many cars are trying to turn left but are unable to get into the left turn lane because of the double yellow line.  In the right lane, there is grass and a curb far to the right of where the lane has been established.  My question is if as a citizen, am I able to make requests for lane expansion?  In this case, it seems that the grass property in between the road and the curb is already owned by the DOT (?) and the road is not taking full advantage of its space!  As the university grows and traffic increases, I hate to see Wrightsville remain so congested as it is in some ways, the heart of Wilmington.  Many wonderful businesses are around Wrightsville and College and I think we\\'re doing a disservice to drivers and business owners by not expanding the unpaved land on Wrightsville Ave., close to the College Rd. Intersection.  I appreciate your time and help with this, any suggestions of \\where to go next\\\" would be greatly appreciated!     \"", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=19997 NOTE: I'm hoping to add a phone number to that answer for people with similar requests for DOT. Thanks for asking! "}
