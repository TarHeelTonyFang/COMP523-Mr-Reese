{"title": "When will they ever finish the traffic island on George Anderson, directly behind Halyburton Park. They tried once by installing plastic poles which were taken down a short time after they installed them. They keep getting knocked down. The island needs to be just like the island outside Empie Park on Park Ave. Is it that hard to copy a idea which seems to work? It\\'s the same island/plan.

Do we really need to treat every island as if it is the first one we ever built !", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=12834  "}
