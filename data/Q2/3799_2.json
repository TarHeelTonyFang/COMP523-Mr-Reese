{"title": "When you see a ship docking at the port and there are tugs in the river - what is the long floating buoy doing in the river?  It looks like a some sort of buoy or line to covers the entire width of the river.  You can see it when driving over the bridge.  Curious to see what it is.  It looks like the emergency buoy lines they have for oil spills.  It looks like they have it stretched out in an unorganized line.\n\nThanks!", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=5893 "}
