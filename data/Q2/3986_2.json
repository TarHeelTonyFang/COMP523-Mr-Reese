{"title": "wherre can we find out the location of the various public right of ways throughout new hanover county?  specifically, there is one located off of dunbar road, which is off of middlesound road in the ogden area.  i was told there is county-owned, and maintained property that allows access to the water there.  i am looking for additional locations to launch my kayak.  i was told the community there was against the county opening the area to the public, so the county agreed to not publicize the location, but there is a sign on a dirt/gravel road that identifies it as a watershed protection area?  i tried to go down the road but turned around as i encountered numerous signs saying it was private property.  could you shed some information on this?  thanks.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=4328 "}
