{"title": "I live in walking distance to my son\\'s school, Parsley Elementary; however, there are no sidewalks leading up Masonboro Loop Rd. to get to the school as safely as I\\'d like. I walk anyway to enjoy the beautiful weather, to give my son and me exercise and conversation on the way home, and to avoid the unnecessary gas that is used idling in a school pick-up line. I have called the city several times to inquire about sidewalks, and last I spoke to someone (in the fall), there were no plans to get sidewalks built to the school up Masonboro Loop Rd. from the plaza with Sienna and Halligan\\'s. It seems that every school in our county should have sidewalks in every direction from the school for at least a half or quarter mile to promote more foot traffic. Are there any plans I may not be aware of to get a side walk built from the fire station at Masonboro Sound and Masonboro Loop (where the side walk now ends) up to the school? If not, are there steps I can take towards getting sidewalks built?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=3337  "}
