{"title": "I see that the city planning department has approved 4 permits for the construction of a separate, single family dwelling to be built on a non-subdivided lot at 5424 Clear Run Drive in College Acres. There is an existing home on that lot.  The property is in R-15 zoning.  How can someone build another full house on a lot with an existing house when the neighborhood covenants (which are registered) prevent it?  If this house is constructed, then won\\'t the city have to let any city resident construct another house on their property if ground space permits?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=17853 "}
