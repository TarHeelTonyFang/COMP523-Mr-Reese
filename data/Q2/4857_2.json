{"title": "Windgate Drive is located off Carolina Beach Road.  The developer of the houses that are called Arrondale did not turn the roads in that development over to the County when the building was done.  There is no maintenance on any of the streets in the front part of the Kirkwood at Arrondale housing development.  This main road is traveled by school buses and many, many vehicles.  It has gotten to the point where there are so many potholes on Windgate, its like an obstacle course.  The holes are deep and very dangerous.  The residents have no where to turn for help.  The County will not help us and most of the residents that live here just don\\'t know where to turn or who to turn to.  Please, please help us with this severe problem.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=9515 "}
