{"title": "It's been about 3 years since a fire in my neighbor's shed (spontaneous combustion)that took out my shed and personal belongings. There is a huge pile of debris covered with tarps in the area of their shed and for the 3 years since, they've been adding to it. Now the pile includes furniture and who knows what else. Feral cats roam freely, snakes have ample hiding places. Multiple times their trash has been stacked so high, my dogs have been able to pull it over the fence and rummage through it. I not only object, I'm sick of it. Who do i call in New Hanover County to address this???", "text": "Hello.
