{"title": "Why can\\'t pedestrians walk on Marvin K. Moss Rd, the entrance to UNCW Marine research center?  For > 1 year I walked on this road from Masonboro Rd to the parking lot entrance on Marvin K. Moss with my dog.  I never bothered anyone, left the pavement or went anywhere near the guard house.  About 6 weeks ago I was stopped by a UNCW officer and told I couldn\\'t walk on the road because it was private property.  I live across from Marvin K. Moss on Foxwood Lane, a dead end road and and Marvin K. Moss is the nicest place to walk near my house.\n\n\n\n", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=15531  "}
