{"title": "I fly from ILM to PHL several times a year and I have found that USAir is now using smaller aircraft. My trip last Thursday and return today was full on a 50 passenger plane. I have checked ILM to LGA and the same thing. Why has USAir changed to smaller planes? These smaller planes go to a concourse where you have to take a bus to the main terminal...what a pain!!! I hope USAir has a darn good explanation for this!!!", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. Thanks for using MyReporter.com!  http://www.myreporter.com/?p=10602"}
