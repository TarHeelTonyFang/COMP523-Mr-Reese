{"title": "A couple of weeks ago I posted a question regarding the demolition of the bus stop bench and light kiosk near John D Barry Drive on South 17th Street. Now over the weekend someone has placed two green plastic lawn chairs at that site and another pair at the bus stop nearer Halyburton Park. What good person has done this? I see people using these bus stops regularly and I bet they appreciate the effort. I wish I had thought of that gesture. I hope the City and Bus Company makes a note of the need for seating at bus stops.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=19659 "}
