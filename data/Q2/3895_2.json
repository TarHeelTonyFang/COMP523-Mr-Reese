{"title": "Where did the Visitors and Convention Bureau come up with the figure that each tourist in the Wilmington area spends an average of $290 a day?  By my calculations that would require staying in a high cost hotel, eating at full service restaurants, and going to at least 3 or 4 local attractions (Jungle Rapids, the Aquarium, Battleship, etc) every day!  I can\\'t imagine the \\average\\\" tourist does this.  I know I don\\'t spend that kind of money when I travel.  Are they trying to fool themselves and us into thinking the Convention Center will make money?\"", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=8306 "}
