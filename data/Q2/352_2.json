{"title": "At this time of year, and maybe at other times, this question muct come up:\n\n\n\nWhat are the legalities regarding trees that border a property line?  Is the owner or renter of a property that borders another property, resposible for leaf pickup?  I would imagine this question would apply to other situations, such as if a tree fell into a neighbors property.\n\n\n\nI would imagine that that our transplant neighbors would have experiences with leaf blowers (my experience) and snow blowers.\n\n\n\nThank you for your help and great column.\n\n\n\nR.
