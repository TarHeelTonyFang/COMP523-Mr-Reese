{"title": "I live in a smaller subdivision in the County that has small roads. When neighbors have parties, guests park in the street on both sides. One car can go through, but there is no way a firetruck could get through if a house was on fire. Is that even legal, and if so, could we at least have parking restricted to only one side of the road? \n\n\n\nThanks so much for checking into this for our area. I'm certain we're not the only neighborhood with the problem, but it does pose a hazard, in my opinion.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/2010/09/is-there-a-county-or-state-law-that-says-you-cant-park-your-vehicle-on-a-residential-street-if-so-can-your-vehicle-be-towed/ "}
