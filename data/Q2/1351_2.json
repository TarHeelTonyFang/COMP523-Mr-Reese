{"title": "I live on Oak Island. Recently the local airport lengthened its runway to accomodate private jets although I don\\'t think anyone on OI owns one. Recently there seems a tremendous increase in the number of military \\'Ospreys\\' doing \\'touch and go landings\\' although they seem to perch for a while. It is becoming common place to have the house vibrate from the engines of these brutes.\n\nWhat is going on here? Are they paying anything to use KSUT? Is it mandatory that any airport that suits them indulge them? Does AF-1 pay to do touch and goes at WILM? Are we bocoming Military Base OI (they already do exercises here with their own control tower)? Generally you can draw lines along runways and buy a house that is away from those lines. The Ospreys can go anywhere. Okinawa citizens are opposed to them and I can see why. Is OI prepared to deal with one of these suckers crashing?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=15815 "}
