{"title": "I am wondering When they are going to finish the intersection of Wrightsville Ave and Independence Ave. They restarted the work, which is great, and now it seems they left it unfinished, no work being done. They left the pavement extremely uneven which is an annoying bump coming east from downtown. I use this road several times a day. Couldn\\'t they have smoothed it out if they were going to stop work for a while?\n\nWhat is the deal? ", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=8317 "}
