{"title": "Can local politicians accept free tickets to the Wells Fargo Golf Tournament? I wonder if there are any rules for elected officials being given tickets to events.\n\n\n\nDo they have to publicly disclose gifts from a tournament. There are going to be a lot of problems with tournament closing roads and inconveniences to local residents and want to know if Eagle Point can use free tickets to influence local officials.\n\nThanks\n\nThomas", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/2017/03/can-local-politicians-accept-free-tickets-to-the-wells-fargo-golf-tournament-do-they-have-to-publicly-disclose-such-gifts/ "}
