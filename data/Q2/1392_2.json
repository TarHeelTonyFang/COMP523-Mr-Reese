{"title": "I recently purchased the property at 702 S.17th Street. It was originally called Peacock Alley. Peacock Alley was a drive-in that sold hot dogs and other foods and beverages to the locals as they made their rounds to the MilJo, Chick Chick and several other drive-ins around Wilmington.  I would like to know more about Peacock Alley and would really like to have any photographs that may have survived. I am rebuilding the site and I am going to call it The Original Peacock Alley and would really enjoy having any history and photos to place inside the new restaurant. Thank you.
