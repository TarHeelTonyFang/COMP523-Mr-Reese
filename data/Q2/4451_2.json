{"title": "Why does the city allow free on-street parking downtown for vehicles with handicap tags?  There is a terrible abuse of this program and the City Parking system is being fleeced.  Every day I watch dozens of vehicles pull up to parking spots, hang a handicap tag and walk several blocks to their destination.  At times the majority of the parking spots on Front Street are occupied by these so-called handicapped people not paying the parking meters. Who do I report this misuse of handicap tags to?  Thanks, ", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=2615 Misuse can be reported to the Wilmington Police Department, (910) 343-3600. "}
