{"title": "I am relatively new to NC, last 2 years from Colorado.  I have been looking at relatively low cost, around $150,000, second home residential beach property (fix up and TLC ok).  I have pretty well zoomed in on Oak Island.  I am aware that they are putting in a sewer system and new home buyers will probably have to pay fees and hook-up. Also, I am aware of damage caused by Hurricane Hazel and other storms (your article on history of hurricanes).  Other than the economic downturn, is there a reason so much residential property is for sale on Oak Island?  What factor does insurance play in the equation?  I would appreciate any insights.  Thanks, Joe Mulvey", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=8152 "}
