{"title": "I am looking for an apartment for my adult daughter, who is developmentally disabled.\n\nWe are fortunate to have a portable housing voucher from Maryland.  The problem is that virtually no apartments take the vouchers.\n\nI have heard about an apt near the Main Library, but the name \\Carolina Apts\\\" is out past 30th st on Market.  Would you know the name of a downtown apartment bldg accepting housing vouchers??
