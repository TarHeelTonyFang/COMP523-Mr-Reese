{"title": "Who is responsible for painting lines on the road at the intersection with the Myrtle Grove library and Monkey Junction McDonalds? The road leads to the Monkey Junction Wal-mart  (passes the Chik-fil-a and McDonald\\'s). I know that there are 2 lanes, but the lines are not visible.  It can be confusing for people who do not know! Many times I have almost been sideswiped, and had to brake suddenly to avoid collisions. I cannot believe that no one has taken the time to update this area. ", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=13881 "}
