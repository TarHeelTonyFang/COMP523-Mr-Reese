{"title": "I live in Carolina Hghts under a seldom used flight path for ILM Airport.  However, on weekends, military aircraft use this flight path (always in pairs).  They are so low and so loud that they violate all sound ordinances that apply to commercial and private aircraft flying over residential areas.  Windows shake and all conversation stops because of the deafening roar.  The din can even be heard inside Thalian Hall and thus also City Hall. Kids go running in the house \\scared.\\\"  The airport reports that the FAA does not have an agent at ILM nor does ILM have a noise ordinance officer and thus nothing can be done. The military should be using a military base - not a commercial airport.  What is going on and why is this allowed?\"", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=12951  "}
