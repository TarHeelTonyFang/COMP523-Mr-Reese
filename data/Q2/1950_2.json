{"title": "It seems like a great idea. A parking meter in front of the downtown Post Office that actually collects quarters for the down & out, the homeless, the hungry. But it\\'s basically an empty gesture, it is almost always inoperable. I could not get it to accept a quarter for six months after it was installed. Now it works ~ 25% of the time, and that\\'s being generous. Wilmington has made it\\'s homeless policy well known - out of site, out of mind. Is the homeless parking meter simply a display for tourists?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=8664 "}
