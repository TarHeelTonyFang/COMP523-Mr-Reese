{"title": "With the new elementary school opening this fall in Porters Neck and the plan for a large housing development in the same general area, there will be a considerably hgher volume of traffic on Porters Neck Rd.  Are there any plans to upgrade the traffic circle at Porters Neck and Edgewater Club roads?  For example, circles on Hilton Head island often have a continuous right turn lane from one arm of the circle to the adjacent (right hand) arm, which would move most of the anticipated traffic off the main circle, at least for cars turning from PN Rd. to Edgewater.\n\nAlso in the area surrounding the circle, are there any plans to finish the \u00e4\u00f3\u00ecenhancement\u00e4\u00f3\u009d project, or even to remove the cargo container that has been sitting there for months?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.starnewsonline.com/news/20160809/new-traffic-patterns-likely-for-wells-fargo-championship "}
