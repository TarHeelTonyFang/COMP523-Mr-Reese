{"title": "This answer may take some field work and research ! If you go to the Nature Trail behind the Senior Center and walk the trail, across the bridge, up the path until you reach the next bridge, walk across that bridge an just a little past the gazebo on the left, you will see a cement street sign (I believe) mark on one side SECOND. The other sides are hard to make out the other sides. Is this marker what\\'s left of a city street/intersection? Why was it put up here so long ago? And when?\n\nThank You for your time in this matter.Been wondering !", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=8103 "}
