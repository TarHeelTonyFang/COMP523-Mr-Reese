{"title": "I live off Blue Clay Road near Burton Steel. On Feb. 2,2011, a car ran off the road and hit a tree. On Feb.3, 2011, a different vehicle was in the very same area and hit the very same trees. Is there any way to find out the reason for these two incidents happening in the same area on different days? It was not raining at the time I encountered both of these sites. I am truly hoping it is not due to cell phone usage... possibly deer crossing?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=9561 "}
