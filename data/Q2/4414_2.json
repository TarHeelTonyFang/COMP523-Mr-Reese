{"title": "Why do they keep moving Port City Radio from frequency to frequency? (The station shifted from 93.7 to 95.9 to 103.7 all in the last few months and now it replaced one of my favorite stations The Bone @ 103.7 Why?)", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/2014/06/what-happened-to-the-local-radio-station-the-bone-it-is-no-longer-on-103-7-fm/ As for why they kept moving it, one of the women on the phone said they were just trying to find the right home for the station, but that was not for attribution so I didn't include it in the published answer.
