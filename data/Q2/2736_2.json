{"title": "What happened to The Glenn on Wrightsville beach? It stood on Nathan and lumina streets on the corner, directly across from The oceanic. That Hotel was there for over 60 years it might have even hit 70 years. But I do know it was open for at least 65 years. I would tend to think that a place like that should have been saved from being torn down. The WB museum didn\\'t know anything about it which boggles the mind that was part of history. She opened that up in the 40\\'s a single mother and it wasn\\'t easy to do that in those days. She would have the service men stay there. I would have just thought that would be historical.\n\nIf anyone can give me some information on it I would appreciate it. We used to stay there every year and Naomi Yopp was a dear lady. I was shocked to see it is gone. I knew it was up for sale, I didn\\'t think they would tear it down. So sad!", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=7960  "}
