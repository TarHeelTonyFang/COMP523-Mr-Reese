{"title": "Why are my vechicles taxed at the highest rate possible by the county? When I call the tax office thay already know the line \\I wish I could sell it for that much\\\" by heart. My vechicles are way overvalued and I have to bring my vechiles to the tax office to get them revalued each year. I\\'ve asked why he values are so extremely high only to be told that the values are set by a contract firm somewhere else. The values set are not even close to the real values.
