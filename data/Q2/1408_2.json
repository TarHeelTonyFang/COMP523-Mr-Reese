{"title": "I saw a report on WECT last night about the towing of cars.  I have a question about that. My daughter had an accident and the police had a tow truck from across the river come tow the car. This place was several miles up 421 and it costs us over $400 to retrieve the license plates as the car was totaled. Why would WPD call a service from that far away especially when they charged partly for the distance they towed the car?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=17487 "}
