{"title": "Why don\\'t DOT go and revise the speed limit on HWY 421. It is 55 miles per hour the entire 421 and don\\'t understand why in certain areas that it could not be 60 to 65 miles per hour the road is wide open except for three main intersections. I have seen speed limits where they should be slower and other higher that should not be. I feel like someone is not doing there job the right way, They tell us it is because of accidents and different things to way they are the way the are adjusted too, but what about stop lights it is the same way you need stop lights at certain intersections because of accident but they are not there they wait until someone is killed 10 or more times then they might put up one and then again they might not.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=8088 "}
