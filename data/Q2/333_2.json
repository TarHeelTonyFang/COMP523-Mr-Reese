{"title": "As hurricane seesion draws to a peak and knock on wood we have not had any in the recent years but as i notice these major roadways being widened and some intersections with stop lights on poles i think to ask why has the power company not started to put older power lines underground and the same for other utilities.\n\n\n\nIf you look at it would make more sense because if a storm comes through there is less likely a chance of a person losing power and other utilities because not everyone has cell phones and if a line goes down then they have no communciation. \n\n\n\nI see that they are doing this with new developments but what about the older ones that already have lines why can they not start working on this in small stages. \n\n\n\nLike i pointed out in the long run it will save the customers and the companies money because a storm comes through they are not having to run out everytime and also it saves the companies when it comes to poles and cars hitting them. You will not have as many objects on the side of the road and it would help reduce the cost on them and the driver cause if they run off the road or lose control of their vechile at least their would be no utility pole to hit unless it was one for a traffice light", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=7771 "}
