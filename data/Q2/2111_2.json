{"title": "Recent articles have detailed the fruits of the Ports Security Grants to Wrightsville Beach in the form of two ALPR machines and the County and City getting new patrol boats. Why have we not heard about our Port? Are other local agencies being awarded this money because the Port and their police/security has everything they need, or because they haven\\'t won any grants recently? Are there cases where grants are awarded but the planning/construction falls through and the agency is forced to return the money? Are there discrepancies between what the Port Police request(to their boss) and what ultimately gets requested/purchased by the Port/State?", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20130306/ARTICLES/130309776 "}
