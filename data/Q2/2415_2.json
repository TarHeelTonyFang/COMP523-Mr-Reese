{"title": "We desperately need an earlier traffic sign on the median strip approaching S College Rd on Oleander from the west. It has to indicate the two left lanes are for turning only left onto northbound S College Rd. Every day there are near accidents as drivers illegally change lanes near the intersection moving from the left turn so that they can go straight through the intersection and continue eastward on Oleander.  The city knows about this problem.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=20107 "}
