{"title": "Hello,\n\n\n\nWhile visiting Wilmington, my Brother asked about the movie theaters downtown.  We could only remember the Bijou.  Could you please let me know the names of the other two theaters.  I believe one was on Market Street and the other on Front Street.  We use to save bottle caps to go to the Kids Matinees on Saturdays.\n\n\n\nThank you ", "text": "Hello.
