{"title": "I have a question relating to an old Wilmington cemetery.  When I last visited Wilmington and was driving north on North Kerr Ave., past the airport, between MLK and Bavarian, I noticed the gate to an old cemetery on the east side of North Kerr, a short distance before North Kerr crosses Farley Dr., curves to the left and runs into Bavarian.  I have searched online and Google Earth and it appears that this cemetery backs up to Capital Dr., which is in a commercial area and dead-ends before it reaches North Kerr (the only access from North Kerr to Capital Dr. is via Farley Dr.).  Google Earth\u00e4\u00f3\u00bbs street view shows a sign indicating that the cemetery is called Acorn Branch Cemetery; however, according to everything I\u00e4\u00f3\u00bbve been able to locate on the internet, Acorn Branch Cemetery is on the airport property, off of John Morris Road, and is (obviously) on the west side of North Kerr.  \n\n\n\nUnless -- are there TWO Acorn Branch Cemeteries, one across the street (North Kerr) from the other?\n\n\n\nI am not referring to the Maides Cemetery adjacent to Maides Park \u00e4\u00f3\u00f1 that is quite a distance away. \n\n\n\nCould you shed any light on the identification and history behind this old cemetery?  Thanks very much \u00e4\u00f3\u00f1 I appreciate your time.\n\n\n\nToni Storey\n\n", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=19888 "}
