{"title": "Do Brunswick, New Hanover and Pender counties have plans in place for warding off the anticipated oil contamination from Deep Water Horizon?\n\nIs this a joint effort among the counties?\n\nIs there a task force headquarters where volunteers may contribute time/money/equipment/engineering input?\n\n\n\nHave coastal counties jointly requested emergency State funds for prevention...or will they wait and request clean up funds? (I think I know the answer to this one.)\n\n\n\nSince our inlets are relatively narrow, can we not close them to non-commercial traffic when/if containment booms are in place? (Preventing contamination to our wetlands)\n\n\n\nPrior to the oil\\'s arrival, can the beaches be mechanically scoured along the immediate shoreline, creating a berm or pseudo dune ridge....clean up commenced....and then bull-doze the berm back over the residually affected area?\n\n\n\nOr are we just gonna wait for the oil to arrive before we contemplate a plan of (counter)-attack? (I fear I may know the answer to this one, as well.)\n\n", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20100602/ARTICLES/100609921?p=1&tc=pg "}
