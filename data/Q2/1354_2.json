{"title": "I lived in the Rocky Point area a good portion of my life.  There is a track of land and an old home located at the end of Porters Lane off of Hwy 117.  The road is private access and is long, lined with majestic Magnolia Trees.  What is the history of this property.  I have always heard it was a large plantation and who now owns the property.\n\nThank you.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=19297 "}
