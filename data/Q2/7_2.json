{"title": "  I am curious about who pays for cost overruns on public work projects. I imagine the contractor would pay for incorrect work and/or the engineering firm would pay for incorrect design?\n\n  I noticed on the Wrightsville Avenue and Independence Avenue project that a very large amount of freshly poured concrete in the curbs and sidewalks had to be removed(jack hammered out) so expansion joints could be properly installed(they were not installed in the first pour). This took place during the second week of September.\n\n  The CFPUA sewer project is also experiencing setbacks. What is happening at the intersection of Rose Avenue and Andover Road? After installing the sewer pipe at this location in July and August then proceeding to install miles of addition pipe, they are now digging up the pipe at the intersection of the aforementioned roads. Is this an installation or design issue.Thanx, Brian", "text": "Hello.
