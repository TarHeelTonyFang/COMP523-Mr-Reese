{"title": "Who or what trains future Wilmington police officers? And, on a much broader scale, who or what determines how and by whom police are trained across the U.S.?\n\n\n\nI ask because of the large number of instances both small and large city police departments have (allegedly, of course), assume indifference and a lack of reasonable response, in certain instances, against those they are supposed to serve and protect. Are there state or federal guidelines/rules used to train cadets?\n\n\n\nThank you.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/2016/03/who-or-what-trains-future-wilmington-police-officers/ "}
