{"title": "As I write this, a good friend of mine is watching the last of the flames go out in a fire that just claimed her house.  Everyone got out fine, but they are left with basically nothing but they clothes they put on this morning.  What kind of resources are available to help someone like this?  There are many needs in the family.  My friend is caring for her mother who has Alzheimer\\'s. Her husband has battled throat cancer twice and is now battling Parkinson\\'s.  She is raising her grandson and also has a son living at home.  I want to help, and I am trying to do some foot work so that they know what their options are.  Thank you!!!
