{"title": "I have been researching historic roads by old county and state maps. As I looked over the Brunswick Co. map I learned the road between Belville and Southport (NC 133)was unpaved in 1930 and known as a TS-SC-Gravel road. What does the TS and SC stand for? Also, the state used an A,B,C Class designation to different types of roads they maintained. What did each letter represent?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!
