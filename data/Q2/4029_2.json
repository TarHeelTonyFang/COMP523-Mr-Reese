{"title": "Who could we contact with regard to a home in our neighborhood where trash has been sitting for two weeks or so?  I would think it would be a health hazard for one thing.  I don\\'t know if the house has been foreclosed on or if the owner has passed away, or just what the circumstances are, but the trash still sits there and hasn\\'t been picked up. \n\n\n\nSame question as to who, if anybody, could be contacted to clean up the yard next door to the house with the trash.  The people who lived there and who are still listed as the owners on the NH County records, have moved and it appeared it had been sold.  However, the grass hasn\\'t been cut in weeks and it is an eyesore for our neighborhood.\n\n Thanks.", "text": " Here's a link to the answer to your question. http://www.myreporter.com/?p=18 "}
