{"title": "Why does the DOT not do proper maintenace on the Highways in and around Wilmington.  Examples:  there are hundreds of potholes on the Highway 74 in the Westbound lanes in the Leland area, there are 9 streetlights out, around the Isabell Holmes bridges, weeds and vegetation are 3-4 tall around guard rails and in the medians, trash and litter are everywhere.  These areas are just an eyesore and need attention.  I have complained to DOT but nothing happens.", "text": "  Here are a couple of links to answers to questions related to\nroad maintenance in the region:\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=10849\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=10329\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=6374\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=4003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
