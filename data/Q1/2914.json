{"title": "Yesterday we saw an auto accident where the driver apparently lost control on College and New Center Drive and hit something. The engine gave off a lot of smoke and steam and people thought the engine might start a fire so they tried unsuccessfully to break the windows to get to the driver who appeared to be unconsious. We left as emergency vehicles approached. We didn\\'t see anything in the press that afternoon. Do you know why?\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nDM", "text": "  I\njust checked Wilmington Police Department accident reports for that\nintersection and don't see one dated June 22. It could be that the\nreport hasn't been filed yet or police determined there was no need\nto file a report."}
