{"title": "What happened to being able to post comments on-line to stories appearing in the Star-News online?", "text": "  \n\nHere's a more detailed explanation from Joel Axon, our online\ndirector:\n\n\n\nWhat happened to being able to post comments on-line to stories\nappearing in the Star-News online?\n\n\n\nThe reason we are changing the format for our article comments is\nthat the contract with our current forum provider is ending. As a cost\nsaving measure we are moving to an open source phpBB message board for\ngeneral forums and we are using the article comment function built\ninto our main Web system.\n\n\n\nThis switch provided us with an opportunity to improve our article\ncommenting system. Unfortunately, instability on our site was\ntriggered Thursday when we tried to turn on the new system. We are\nworking with the development team building a new solution with an ETA\nof Friday, Feb. 12. Comments will not be auto-linked to articles until\nthis is ready. Our main focus is stability of the site.\n\n\u00e6\n\nFor the entire forum switch we decided on the phpBB forums [link:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB] because the functionality and look\nof the forums should be extremely similar to the current system. The\nlaunch for this portion of the project is scheduled for February 16.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
