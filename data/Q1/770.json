{"title": "With the amount of home break-in\\'s that have been taking place in the Gordon Woods subdivisions (and the adjacent neighborhoods), why isn\\'t the NHC Sheriffs department offering a reward for information leading to the arrest of the responsible individual(s)?  These B&E\\'s have been steadily increasing for months, and there has been no mention of them on the news, in the paper, or more importantly by the NHC Sheriff\\'s office.  As a recent victim of one of these break-in\\'s (having interrupted the robbery when coming home early), I\\'d like to know why there haven\\'t been increased patrols in the area, and what, if anything is being done to stop this crime wave.", "text": "  \n\n\n\nI'm forwarding your question to our Steven Moore, our public safety\n\neditor, and David Ennis, one of our local news editors, for\nconsideration.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime:\n\n\n\nHere's a link to a related recent story at StarNewsOnline.com:\n\nhttp://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20101210/ARTICLES/101219944?p=all&tc=pgall\n\n\n\nAnd here's a link to the Crime Map at StarNewsOnline.com, where you\n\ncan browse reports of break-ins and other crimes in your area:\n\nhttp://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20100504/MULTIMEDIA/100509884?Title=Wilmington-Crime-Map\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
