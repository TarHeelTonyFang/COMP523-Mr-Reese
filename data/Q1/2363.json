{"title": "Why does the city (or county) not require it\\'s IT department to solicit bids? (Aren\\'t mopst departments required to send our  a bid invitation? This is evident with the City overpaying entities such as Genisys (who had never done an email implementation as large scale as a large city government)for email when they could have purchased Exchange and Shrepoint (Enterprise) directly from Microsoft (Microsoft Office365 or Microsoft (SMB to Enterprise) Online Services) from $4 per month to $24 per month depending on the user options per account. Had the city IT department solicited bids they could have received a lower price with a stronger local provider albiet a local company or not. Reduced cost would have saved the tax payers money, the city would not be having so many email issues and staff time would have been freed up to cover more problematic areas in technology. So why disn\\'t the Technology department for the city or county required to solicit bids? They should be to guarentee tax payers are getting award winning providers at the lowest cost available and the city is getting the best service available? It is also poor decision making on the IT Managers shoulders not to send out RFPs. This allows a single depaertment to besically take favors, deal with friends and is unfair to other area enterprise providers who would like a chance to bid on providing the city and county with exceptional IT services and solutions. It allows for unfair favoritism.\n\n", "text": "  Here's a link to the answer to your question  about IT bidding\nfor the county.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=10646\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
