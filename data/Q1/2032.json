{"title": "I heard on the radio this morning that the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, a state run program, closed in January. As a result those who cannot afford medication for HIV/AIDS are struggling to gain access to these medications. From what I heard, it sounded like this progam used to run on a 7 million dollar budget. That is a lot of money. Is there more information why this program has ended (ex. mismanagement or budget cuts) and what alternative resources exist for those who were recieving medicaions through this program. \n\nThank you.
