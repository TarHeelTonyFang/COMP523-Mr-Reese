{"title": "There was a wreck on top of the I-140 overpass, over Hwy 421 approximately 9:30 a.m. yesterday, Tuesday, February 8th.  I saw a flatten car on its side in the eastbound lane where traffic doesn\\'t normally flow since the I-140 on ramp is the only traffic heading east.  I was surprised not to see anything on the news today about this accident.  Do you have any information?  Thank you from a curious citizen. ", "text": "  \n\n\n\nShelby checked with the N.C.
