If a report about a specific incident\nisn't posted to those public sites, there will be no report displayed\nin the crime map or at MyBackyardNC.com. Exceptions are reports for\nCarolina Beach and Wrightsville Beach police departments, which are\ngathered by a MyBackyardNC.com correspondent. Kure Beach has a manual\nsystem for submitting reports to MyBackyardNC.com.\n\n\n\nStarNews Mugshots information is gathered from the New Hanover County\nSheriff's Office public site and has the same restrictions as the\ncrime map and MyBackyardNC.com.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
