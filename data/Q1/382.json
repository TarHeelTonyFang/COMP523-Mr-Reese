{"title": "Please advise me on what legal action I need to take regarding some nuisance children that run around my neighborhood unsupervised. Should I contact Social Services, Wilmington Police, or some other agency? I have tried speaking to the children, but clearly they are not being taught any better in their home, and they continue to trespass on my (and my neighbor\\'s) property, and taunt drivers by not moving out of the street, etc. I do not allow my dog to run on their property and I expect the same courtesy in return regarding their children.
