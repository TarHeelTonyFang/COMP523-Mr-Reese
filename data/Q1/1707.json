{"title": "When will Wilmington get a CW television network channel?  It is the only major television network not available over the air here (free TV).", "text": "  \n\nIt's not going to be made available as far as we could find. Those\ndecisions are based on ad sales and how much the cable and networks\ncan get off it being carried, well, free.\n\nIf you'd like to push for this, we suggest contacting your local TV\nstations or start a petition to get the show carried locally. More\nvoices often equal results."}
