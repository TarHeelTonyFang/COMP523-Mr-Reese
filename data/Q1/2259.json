{"title": "I have two questions that may not be in your department to answer so if not please direct them to the correct department.\n\nThe 1st is I enjoy the Hocus Focus cartoon but wonder why it is in color every day except on Sundays?\n\nThe 2nd is do the paper delivery persons have to buy the plastic sleeves that they use on rainy days or does the newspaper provide them? \n\n", "text": "  Here are the answers to your questions:\n\n\n\nHocus Pocus runs on the puzzle page on Sundays, which is not a color position for the press printing. The other days of the week it publishes on a different page, which is always a color position.\n\n\n\nDelivery people do need to buy any plastic bags they put the newspaper in, but they don't have to buy them from the StarNews.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
