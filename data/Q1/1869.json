{"title": "how far back can you research wilmington newspapers?", "text": "  \n\nThe news archive on our website (down at the bottom left of the home\npage)has articles back to 2002 online. In addition, this links to a\nGoogle newspaper archive that includes some StarNews archives back\ninto the 1970s, but the Google collection is not complete, so searches\ncan be hit-or-miss sometimes. The New Hanover County Public Library\nlocal history room has archive copies of the newspaper on microfilm\nand some paper copies that date back into the late 1800s. The local\nhistory staff also has clip files on many topics and the staff there\ncan assist you in research.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
