{"title": "I received a phone call tonight soliciting for the Wilmington Fraternal Order of Police. The caller mentioned that they are trying to raise money for Christmas gifts for underpriveleged children in our city. Sounds like a great cause but the caller was unable to give me a valid website to refer to. Is this a valid organization? How can I check to make sure I am not getting swindled? Thanks for your reply.  ", "text": "  The\nFraternal Order of Police is a legitimate organization. The local\nchapter doesn't have a website of its own, but there is a state\nFraternal Order of Police website with information about the local\nchapter and the names of its officers: http://www.ncfop.org/\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
