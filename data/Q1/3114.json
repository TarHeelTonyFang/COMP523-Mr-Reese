{"title": "When are they going to place a Teen Club or a bid hang out spot for Teens in Brunswick County or Wilmington? \n\n\n\nWhy want they widen 133/River Road down by Fuston Road and toward Orton Plantation or a least repave the bad spots.\n\n\n\nWhen are they going to put a stop light at Dawson Creek and 133. This is a very bad spot to pull out from.\n\n\n\n", "text": "About the teen club, unfortunately we can't answer speculative\nquestions about services or retail developments at MyReporter.com. If\nsuch a service or development is announced, it will be reported in the\nStarNews and at StarNewsOnline.com.\n\n\n\nAbout improvements to N.C. 133 between Leland and Southport, we know\nof no plans to widen that road or add stoplights. We're not sure\nwhere Dawson Creek is other than in television reruns, but DOT has\nrebuilt and improved bridges crossing Town Creek and Allen Creek in\nrecent years.\n\nHope that helps."}
