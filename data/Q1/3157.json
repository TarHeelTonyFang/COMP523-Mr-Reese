{"title": "Hi! This is the time of the year when mosquitoes are at their worst. I find that when I go out and empty birdbaths, plant saucers, gutters, etc...they are not quite so bad. My question: Why doesn\\'t the City of Wilmington do a flyer or a news brief or ... about everyone pitching in and trying to minimize the mosquito problem in our area?", "text": "Because the city does spray for mosquito control, they are doing\nsomething about the problem. However, you're right in that the\ncommunity as a whole could -- and really needs -- to do more. While\nthere are no immediate plans for such measures you write of, in these\ninstances we tell readers that the more people write the city and\ncounty about these complaints, the more likely it is they will respond\nand do something about it.\n\nThanks for using MyReporter.com"}
