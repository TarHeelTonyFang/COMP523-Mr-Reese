{"title": "Part of my job involves a lot of driving in Pender County\\'s rural roads.  Often, I see dead cats, dogs, deer, and raccoons littering the sides of the highways.  Even on the bigger roads, such as 117 and 421, these dead critters seem like they\\'re often left for weeks to decompose in plain view.  As an animal lover, this makes my drive something I almost dread.  Is it someone\\'s job to pick up these poor dead creatures?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nHere's a link to a recent story at StarNewsOnline.com that should\nanswer your question:\nhttp://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20101108/ARTICLES/101109666?p=all&tc=pgall\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
