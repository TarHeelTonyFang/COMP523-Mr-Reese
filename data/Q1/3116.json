{"title": "http://www.wect.com/story/19518269/nhcso-corporal-threatens-co-worker-pulls-gun-on-superior\n\n\n\nWhy does a corporal ( real good way to show leadership ) of the sheriff\\'s office get to pull his gun on one of his managers and the DA\\'s office does nothing about it? But if I took my gun into work in the morning and threatened one of my managers with it, I would be shot down or perhaps years in prision, and hasn\\'t someone reported his ability to violate code of conduct and/or rules in the past? Just trying to figure out where is justice when only certain individuals are choosen for the cruel and unethical operations of New Hanover County Court house. Why is it this civil servant getting to live above the law ?\n\n", "text": "According to the TV station's story, the sheriff said decided not to\ncharge the corporal because he was on medication and had no previous\nrecord.\n\nIf we go ask the question, we'll get the same answer.\n\nIf you would like to post a letter to the editor, here's where you\ncan do that: http://www.starnewsonline.com/section/letters\n\n"}
