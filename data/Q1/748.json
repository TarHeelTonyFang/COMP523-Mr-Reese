{"title": "I have been to a local gas station in Wilmington to purchase $20.00 worth of gas with a check card on a local bank Why does the local gas station send in a credit for $100.00. They gave me the run around when I called them. They said that it was the banks fault then said that it was the credit card companies fault. What they are doing is holding my $100.00 until the bank pays them the original $20.00 I spent. Needless to say this causes overdrafts to my account, but the bank straightens it out and credits me back the money with no overdrafts attached. This seems like it would be illegal to charge intially $80.00 more than I spent originally.
