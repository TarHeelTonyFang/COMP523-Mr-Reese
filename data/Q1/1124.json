{"title": "Why aren\\'t there health score regulations on ice cream/chocolate shops in downtown Wilmington? I was told by Kilwin\\'s management that they did not receive a health inspection because they did not serve bananas. Somehow this doesn\\'t seem right to me, especially when they make waffle cones, fudge, and other products in the store. They\\'re employees are also not required to wear gloves when they have cuts and burns from the waffle iron. I used to work there and have seen first hand the unsanitary conditions behind the counter. For example, roaches crawling all over ice cream cones, cups, spoons, milkshake machine, popcorn maker and counter tops. I was even told by a supervisor to scoop a fly out of an ice cream tub and continue using it. I made a complaint to the health department but nothing was done. So hopefully you could help me figure out why Kilwin\\'s is not required to have a health inspection.", "text": "  \n\n\n\nThe state regulations regarding food service sanitation seem to\nexclude places that just scoop ice cream.
