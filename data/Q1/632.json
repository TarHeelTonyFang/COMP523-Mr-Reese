{"title": "I have a neighbor that lives behind me that has a forest of weeds taking over their entire backyard.  It is so bad that it is starting to grow into my yard.  I have to work very hard to cut down and trim their mess 1-2 times a year to keep it from taking over my yard.  Is there a law or something that requires people to take care of their yard especially if its protruding into other yards?  I live in the downtown area, not in an HOA protected neighborhood.", "text": "  \n\n\n\nI believe this previous answer to a MyReporter.com question is what\n\nyou're looking for.
