{"title": "This afternoon my wife and I drove from Myrtle Beach to Carolina Beach to visit with family. We took the Southport-Fort Fisher Ferry rather than drive through Wilmington. When the ferry pulled out into the channel, we saw a ship in the distance, coming toward us (it was moving toward the ocean). When it got closer we could see that it was a container ship and two small boats were near it. One of the small boats was on the ships starboard, toward the stern. The other was on the ships port. A couple of times it zoomed away from the ship then slowed down and poked along for a couple of minutes and then returned to it\\'s position on the ships port. When we got closer to the ship the small boat came toward us at a high rate of speed, slowed down, and assumed a position off our port bow between the ferry and the container ship. We were now close enough to see that the small boat was an inflatable/rigid hulled coast guard boat with two large outboards. There were flashing lights above its console. I think they were blue. Between the console and bow was a pedestal with a gun that looked like a machine gun to me. It was manned by a Coast Guardsman. When we had passed the container ship, the Coast Guard boat returned to its station with the ship. Shortly, if left again to do the same thing with a tug boat behind us pulling a dirlect ship hull.\n\n\n\nDo you have any idea what was going on?", "text": "  \n\nWe weren't able to track down details on the specific incident you\ndescribe. However, the Coast Guard frequently steps up security when\nships from Sunny Point are carrying ammunition in and out of the\nharbor. In addition, security measures have been stepped up around the\nports in general.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
