{"title": "Boy I love you guys ... here\\'s my questions for today.  In Southport at the intersection of Southport/Supply Road and Long Beach Drive property has been cleared (next to Bank of America and in front of Lowes Home) ... what\\'s going in there?  And before you get to Midway Road on 211 property has been cleared, what\\'s going in here?  I\\'ve heard a Holiday Inn.\n\n\n\nThanks for your outstanding work, --debi", "text": " \n\nWe're looking into the first site you mentioned, and will do a story\nwhen we confirm something. There are a number of lots being cleared in\nthat area for the second bridge corridor and shopping centers."}
