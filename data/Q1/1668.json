{"title": "Why do I get kicked off of Time Warner Cable so much? I have 4 TV\\'s in the house and the only one that routinely gets kicked off is the one with the box from Time Warner for use with the HD TV set. When I called Time Warner they told me it was because they were doing upgrades but I get kicked off at least 6 times a day, all hours of the day and it usually takes about 15 minutes for it to reboot. The record was one Sunday not too long ago when we got kicked off 10 times in one morning Thank you", "text": "  \n\nI'm afraid I can't offer any answers on technical difficulties.
