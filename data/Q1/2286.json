{"title": "I have wondered why NCDOT allows Porters Neck Road to flood on a very dangerous curve near the PN Clubhouse. With any heavy rain one lane is completly covered. I have photographs showing cars going into west lane to avoid water. Almost causing wreck to oncoming traffic.\n\n\n\nThere is a ditch next to road that would seem to be capable of taking water off road but it doesn\\'t.\n\n\n\nThanks as i am worried someone is going to have serious accident because of something that could be avoided. There at least should be a permenant road flood sign to warn people\n\nThanks\n\nSteve\n\n", "text": "  Here's a link to a previous answer that addresses your\nquestion.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=8245\n\n\n\nIf this is an ongoing problem, please local news editor David Ennis\nat (910) 343-2389.\n\n\n\n   "}
