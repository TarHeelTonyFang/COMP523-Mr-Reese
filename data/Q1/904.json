{"title": "What are the rules for the moped drivers? I don\\'t know how many times lately I have been stuck behind a moped in a 40 - 45 mph lane for them to be riding smack dab in the center not allowing anyone to get by. Are there not rules they must follow and why do the police/sherriff not do anything about this. And some of the mopeds go faster than the limites set for a nonlicensed vehicle.Thanks", "text": "  \n\n\n\nMoped drivers must follow the same rules that other vehicles must\nfollow, except for one thing: They aren't required to have insurance,\nwhich coupled with their cheap costs, is a main reason for their\npopularity.\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=2628\n\n\n\nHowever, like all vehicles, it is illegal for them to impede the flow\nof traffic. It's also illegal for anyone on a moped to speed."}
