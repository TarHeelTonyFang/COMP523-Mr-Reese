I've met people and done things I never would have had\nthe opportunity to meet or do otherwise.\n\n\n\nBut along with that access comes the responsibility to use it wisely.\nThose who become sources, willingly or otherwise, depend on us to be\nfair and accurate. Readers depend on us to serve as surrogate\nquestioners for them.\n\n\n\nI hope that answers your question. Do you mind if I ask what prompted\nyou to ask?\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, here's a link to an answer that might interest\nyou:\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=8546\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
