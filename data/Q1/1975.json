{"title": "If downsizing by 101.3 caused the lay-off of Brian the Stuntboy, then how come they have hired a new morning DJ to work with Linda?", "text": "  \n\nThis question really should be addressed to the station. The original\nquestion has been one of our most popular in regards to comments, and\nwe encourage Stuntboy fans to direct all of those comments and\nconcerns to the station itself. Station management really aren't\nunder any obligation to tell us about their hiring practices, but\nwould be more open to hearing comments from listeners. Thanks!"}
