{"title": "I recently called the City of Wilmington to have a recycle bin dropped off to our new house.  At the present time the city doesn\\'t have any bins to distribute. Can I use any container and place it on the street to be picked up along with our neighbors recycle bins?", "text": "  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe city expects to receive recycling bins within the next two\n\nweeks.\n\n  \u00f1There has been a significant increase in demand for bins because\n\nof the new state plastic recycling law. Customers are asked to\ncollect\n\ntheir recyclables and keep them until the bins can be delivered,\u00ee\ncity\n\nspokeswoman Malissa Talbert says.\n\n  After the bins are received, \u00f1the city will distribute them as\nsoon\n\nas possible,\u00ee Talbert says.\n\n  \u00f1The bins are important because that is how workers know there is\n\nrecycling to be picked up and not just extra trash,\u00ee she says.\n\n  The city of Wilmington provides weekly curbside recycling at no\n\nextra charge to all city trash pick-up customers. Talbert says that\n\nless than half of the city\u00cds trash customers recycle, so the state\nlaw\n\nthat took effect Oct. 1 \u00f1is helping to encourage more recycling.\u00ee\n\n  The city recycles plastics, cans, paper and cardboard. Materials\n\ndon\u00cdt have to be sorted.\n\n  \u00f1The bin just needs to be placed at the curb and it will be picked\n\nup the same day as trash is picked up,\u00ee Talbert says.\n\n  The city also provides yard waste pickup at no extra charge. Bulky\n\nitems such as sofas and refrigerators will be picked up upon request\n\nat no extra charge.\n\n  To begin recycling, call the city at 341-7875.\n\n"}
