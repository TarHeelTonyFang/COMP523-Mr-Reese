{"title": "When digital TV came online, I began experiencing low frequency vibrations 24/7 in both my ears while inside my house. This wakes me in the morning usually around 3 a.m. I live near Time Warner\\'s satellites.  I also feel the vibrations in the building where I work which is near the TV station downtown. Has anyone else experienced this vibration problem?  I suspect this is due to high power digital transmissions by the TV stations and data transmitters in the Wilmington area.  Can anything be done about this?  Can you give me the specific name of a contact person at the FTC?  ", "text": "  \n\n\n\nI haven't noticed it. Do you have a DTV converter box? Perhaps it's\ndefective?\n\n\n\nHere's a link where you can file complaints with the FCC:\nhttp://esupport.fcc.gov/complaints.htm\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
