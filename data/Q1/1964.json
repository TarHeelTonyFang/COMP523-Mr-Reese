Mr Caldwell was drinking prior to the accident. It was his first offense which he served 4 years 11 months.Just recently Stephanie Wells was charged with the same crime, same charges and was sentenced to 7 years which the DA reversed to 5 years probation. She fled the scene leaving a man to die in the street. Is the justice system in Wilmington fair?
