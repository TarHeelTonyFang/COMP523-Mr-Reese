{"title": "Why is only the front page of a Police report from Pender County public record?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nIt looks like you didn't receive our previous response:\n\n\n\nChapter 132 of the N.C. General Statutes, which deals with public\n\nrecords, doesn't specifically address which page of the complaint\nis\n\nto be made public. \n\n\n\nHere's a link to that chapter:\n\nhttp://www.legislature.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_132/GS_132-1.4.html\n\n\n\nIf the second page contains investigative notes, it probably isn't\n\npublic. However, if the second page simply contains a narrative of\n\nwhat you told the sheriff's office, it would be public.\n\n\n\nPerhaps you should ask the sheriff's office for a description of\nthe\n\nsecond page so you will know how to proceed.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
