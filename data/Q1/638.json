{"title": "Why doesn,t Wilmington join Charleston, S.C. and develope a departure port for cruise ships.  Seems a perfect fit (and location) for the port facilities. Parking facilities would seem to be the biggest obstacle and easily could be obtained from the many empty warehouses around.  This should be a boom business for Wilmington boosting tourism, food service,  hotel, etc.  We are tired of having to drive to Charleston and even Florida to board a cruise ship.\n\nThanks for taking my question and I will look forward to a front page response soon. (or any page will do).\n\nWe are a Star News Home Dely Subscriber.\n\nDon and Rocky Doutt\n\nSneads Ferry, NC", "text": "  \n\n\n\nI believe this previous post at MyReporter.com addresses your\nquestion: http://www.myreporter.com/?p=3346\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
