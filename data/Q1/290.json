{"title": "Why does the council and mayor think a $174,000 choker system at the intersection of Amber Dr. and Wickford in Oxford Place is better than 2 additional stop signs, that were removed in the 90\\'s? Where do they think that money comes from? Telling us it is from a referendum in 2008, doesn\\'t mean the tax payers aren\\'t going to pay. Has anyone watched how much room the school buses, fire trucks, moving vans etc need to turn at that intersection? The schools could put the difference in the cost of 2 stops signs instead of $174,000+ to better use.
