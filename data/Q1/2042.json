The man was unarmed, intoxicated, and injured.  He was in his own house.  He was 5\\'8\\.  49 years old and out of shape.  What earthly reason would there be for a trained Deputy to taser the man  and then shoot him.  Either the Deputy is in need of further training or other motives were at play.  Police deal with drunk drivers all the time and somehow dont have to resort to deadly force. If the Deputy felt the man was a threat surely he could have subdued him physically handcuffed him and taken him in.  I have to question the ability of this Deputy.  Should he be on the force?  Which one of us will be his next victim?\"\n", "text": "  \n\nWe're continuing to cover this story and will add any and all\ndetails (including the ones you've asked) in our coverage.
