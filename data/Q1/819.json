The public needs to be informed & aware !", "text": "  \n\n\n\nIn addition to police blotter items that usually appear in the B\nsection of the StarNews print edition, public safety reporters Matt\nTomsic and Brian Freskos also write the Behind the Yellow Tape blog\nabout crime at StarNewsOnline.com. Reports about home invasions and\nother serious crimes will be found in those places.\n\n\n\nOn the home page of StarNewsOnline.com you also will find a link to\nthe crime map that displays information from Wilmington and New\nHanover County about arrests, crimes and traffic accidents for the\npast 30 days.\n\n\n\nMore of that information also is available at MyBackyardNC.com, a sub\nsite of StarNewsOnline.com. Reports are broken down by 36\nneighborhoods in New Hanover County.\n\n\n\nPeople arrested and jailed in New Hanover County also are featured in\nour Mug Shots website, accessible from the home page of\nStarNewsOnline.com.\n\n\n\nIn short, we publish information about all home invasions and other\nserious crimes as we learn about them. Access to some reports from the\nWPD and NHCSO is delayed, especially over weekends, as a result of\ntheir filing procedures, not ours.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
