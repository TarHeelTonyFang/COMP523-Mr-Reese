{"title": "My wife and just came back from Norfolk Virginia via Hwy 17. North of Elizabeth City we crossed a bridge that had a sign the indicated we were crossing the Intracoastal Waterway but there was no body of water under it that you could see (of significant size for the ICWW) nor did any water body show up on my Garmin GPS. What is that all about? Just curious.", "text": " \nNormally we focus here on items of interest in Southeastern North\nCarolina, so this is a little far afield. But it is likely you may be\nreferring to a crossing along the Dismal Swamp Canal, which connects\nwhat is now the Dismal Swamp wildlife refuge to the Pasquotank River\nand the Intracoastal Waterway at Elizabeth City. It's an alternate\nroute on the Waterway, which also carries traffic along a branch\ntoward Coinjock. It's a historic canal, dating back to the late 1790s\nand contains the only locks on the Intracoastal Waterway. If you look\nup the waterway on the Army Corps of Engineers website, you can find\nmore information.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
