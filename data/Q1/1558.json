{"title": "Why hasn\\'t Catch opened in Ogden?", "text": "  \n\nCatch owner (and amazing chef) Keith Rhodes has pushed the opening\nback a few times now, but the restaurant is still scheduled to open in\nthe next month or so. As with all new business openings, there are\nMANY variables that can push the open date back some, and with\nKeith's very busy schedule at Catch and Deluxe, there have been\ndelays. Look for it to open in the next month or, at the very least,\nhave the actual opening date be advertised.\n\n"}
