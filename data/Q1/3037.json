{"title": "At the New Hanover County School Board\\'s redistricting forum held at Noble Middle School on Oct. 19, a gentleman(parent)spoke on microphone and mentioned a map he devised as an alternative to the three maps currently being considered. (He may have also spoken the week before at the forum held at Myrtle Grove Middle School and presented his idea to the board members.)  He implored the board to consider his proposed map. The NHCS site has not posted his map for public viewing...and I\\'m not sure they plan to.   I am very interested in seeing his proposed map and/or knowing his name so that I may contact him to view the map. How can we find out the man\\'s name or know if his proposed map is being circulated for others to view?", "text": "  This\nis part of an ongoing story that we're tracking, so I passed this\nalong to the team covering the redistricting issue. We'll keep\nupdating things as they develop.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
