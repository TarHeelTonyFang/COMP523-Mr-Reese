{"title": "Why do parents think they are exempt from the law. Everyday I see parents at Pine Valley Elementary break traffic laws and act like it is no big deal. There used to be a motorcycle policeman that would give citations and when he did he would get cussed out. They haven't been around for a while and when they are not around parents just do what they want to do. I have also seen parents just stop in the middle of Shipyard Blvd and let their kids out. Do these parents not realize the law is set for a reason? Why won't anyone do anything about this? One government entity blames the other, the school board in particular. It seems like they would take the initiative and do something although they will use the excuse that they don't control the streets. This may be true but it is their schools that are causing the problem. Someone, somewhere needs to do something, these parents need to start obeying the law and stop doing things because they are in a hurry. We are all in a hurry but not all of us choose to act ignorant and put others at harm     ", "text": "  Here's a link to an answer that addresses your question.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/2012/12/16730/\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
