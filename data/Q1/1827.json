{"title": "About a week ago you reported that a abandon boat was found buy the coast guard with drugs and weapons and that the coast guard arrested the person.  Why was the persons name not released? What was the persons name  aren\\'t arrests public record", "text": "  \n\nThat story was done by an Associated Press writer, meaning local\nreporters at the StarNews did not cover that particular story. The\nreason the individual's name was not released is because the story\nwas likely done from an arrest report, which either did not include\nthe name or was withheld while the coast guard investigated the drug\ncharge. The AP writer added a call to the coast guard was not\nreturned, so that piece of information was lacking in the report. I\nwill check with our Brunswick news team to see if they will be doing a\nfollow-up story on the arrest."}
