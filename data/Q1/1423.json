{"title": "Is there a law enforcement convention of some sort going in Wilmington? When I saw a Robeson County Sheriff\\'s Dept. vehicle this a.m. on Market St., I was wondering why the vehicle would be here in N.H. County but didn\\'t really think much of it. However, a few minutes later I saw two Garden City (not sure if they were Police Dept. or Sheriff\\'s Dept. and, of course, I don\\'t know where Garden City is) law enforcement vehicles on College Rd. I\\'m not smart enough to figure out whether it\\'s just a random occurrence, or if there is something specific that brought these officers to the Port City.", "text": "  \n\n\n\nWe've asked around and haven't come up with an answer yet.\nFrequently officers from out of the county come to town to transport\nprisoners or attend training. For example, there's a regional\ntraining center at Fort Fisher. If we find out more, I'll let you\nknow.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
