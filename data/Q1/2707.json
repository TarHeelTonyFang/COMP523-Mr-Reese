{"title": "What happened to Buster the big alligator that for 50 years or more was seen in Orton Gardens?  Someone told me that they were sure it had been killed at the access road to Brunswick Town and Orton pond.  Can anyone find out if this happened, it was in the spring, April or May 2011, if my memory id correct.  Does not seem to matter to the new owner or to David Sprunt an endangered animal that helped his family to profit for years may have been killed almost as soon as the property changed hands. As for the new owner, right just thinning out a few trees and opening a pheasant hunting club. We were born at night but not last night.", "text": "  Here's a link to the answer to your question.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=11507\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
