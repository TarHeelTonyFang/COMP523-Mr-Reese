{"title": "I saw a possibly option for the new river crossing by connecting the intersection of US74/74/421 to a new road south, over the river and connect at Front street/3rd street/carolina beach road at Greenfield lake.  \n\nSeems like the best solution as truck would get off the main roads quicker, none going through the 3rd street to downtown. \n\n\n\nIs there any new information on this possible choice?  Where to write to express preference of this possible option? \n\n", "text": "  Here's a link to a recent story about the 12 options for a new river crossing:\n\n\n\nhttp://www.starnewsonline.com/news/20160522/still-a-long-road-to-any-new-cape-fear-river-crossing\n\n\n\nIt includes a link to a state website with details and contact info for the project hotline.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
