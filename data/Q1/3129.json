{"title": "I was visiting with two older sisters close to White Lake NC. I was only 10, but remember it as it were yesterday. We came up over a knoll on a back road and a huge fireball was hovering over the road right in front of us. We didn\\'t know what to do, as the light kept getting closer. We had to pull over on the shoulder of the road and it would zoom out then zoom in. We watched for about 15 minutes then it just poof and it was gone.", "text": "Amazing story.\n\nWhite Lake is a Carolina Bay, which are somewhat mysterious in\nthemselves:\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=1520\n\nThanks for sharing!"}
