{"title": "I am resubmitting this since I previously gave you a bellsout.net email address.\n\n\n\nI purchased a new front loading washing machine that was installed in late April 2010.

After the technician replaced the part that the company suggested was the problem, the unit is still having the same issue.  I am not satisfied with the company\\'s response.  Is there a local consumer advocate that can assist in situations like mine?", "text": "  \n\nThe state Attorney General's office has a consumer complaints\ndivision that might be able to offer some advice\n\nhttp://www.ncdoj.com/Consumer.aspx\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
