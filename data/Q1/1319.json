{"title": "Who do we have to contact to get ramps cut into the sidewalks at the edges at roads? I have to use a mobility scooter and quite often have to ride a good ways down a side street just to be able to get to the road to cross it. I thought these were required by law now? If so the area around Carolina Beach Road and Shipyard needs to get done. I\\'ve been asking for over 10 years now and calling the city has been a complete waste of time... Do I have to create a lawsuit to get the city to obey the law?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nTry contacting Jonathan Batts, ADA coordinator for the city of\nWilmington,at 102 N. 3rd Street, P.O.
