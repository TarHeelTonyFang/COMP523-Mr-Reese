{"title": "Is the city putting up a fence on wrightsville ave at the culveret by the tin roof appartments on the east side? this area is a beautiful view of the marsh and a place to launch a kayak or canoe for people like me who enjoy nature . Is this Legal to close an area of the marsh? I am going to take pictures and get a petition going to get It open.  Also the city has property all around randal pond and the only place you can launch a kayak or canoe is on the north side with a six foot drop risking a bad fall or injury. Now on the south side on the Deveron park  area there is a perfect area ,gentle slope and shallow water and ample parking. Seems to me that this would be the place to have a city launch area. Please reply. thank you.   Edward Letendre", "text": "  Here's a link to the answer to your question.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=11365\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
