{"title": "Recently I learned that the Chief Of Police in Carolina Beach hired a female officer who just finished a police training program as a part time police officer. He created a special position for her as a water patrol officer. It was just announced that the Chief Of Police and his wife have seperated and his wife sent a letter to the Carolina Beach Mayor, Town Council Members and Town manager to announce that the Chief and this female police officer have been having an affair for many months. The Chief\\'s wife stated that she felt it was unethical for the Chief to hire this female officer, since there were more qualified applicants with previous experience who applied for the open job as well as oxiliary officers ( unpaid volunteers) who should have been considered for the position before this brand new person with no previous experience. \n\n\n\nIf this is the case, then the rights of other qualified police officer candidates were violated and this is an unethical hiring violation.  If the Chief of Police of Carolina Beach actually has been involved with this female police officer - he hired, he should be terminated from his position. \n\nI asked the Town Manager about this and he has no comment. \n\nCan you find out about this? \n\n\n\n", "text": "  \n\nI passed this along to the editor and reporter who cover Carolina\nBeach \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
