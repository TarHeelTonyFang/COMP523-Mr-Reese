{"title": "A truck is making a turn in the left turning lane and there is an on coming car with the right of way.  The truck claims he did not see the car, they must have been speeding, they ran a red light and stated they just want to get paid! While reporting the accident to his trucking company.  They had a head on collision.  Who bares the burden of proof as to which car actually has the right of way?  Does the truck crossing over a right of way lane bare the burden of proof that the car with the right of way ran a red light? I think the truck should have to prove the car with the wright of way ran a red light.  Do you agree?  State why?
