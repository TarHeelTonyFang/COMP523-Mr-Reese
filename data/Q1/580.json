She\u00cds\nbeen down there 23 years and said she can definitely tell you Elvis\nPresley never owned property on the island.  She said there are no\npink Cadillacs on the island, either.\n\n\n\nPresley, the undisputed King of Rock \u00cdn\u00cd Roll, died on Aug. 16, 1977.\nAt that time, Figure Eight was not substantially developed.
