{"title": "What happened to Harvard Jennings from WAAV 980AM? \n\n\n\nMr. Jennings and I are diametrically opposites on political matters, but he earned my respect over the many years I listened to him. \n\n\n\nHe is a very honest, honorable man, and someone who I miss. I have listened to him since 1992 when he was a guest host on many programs. His sense of right and wrong were very clear, and I totally agreed with him on moral issues...\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nBill Bryan\n\nKure Beach, NC", "text": "  \n\n\n\nHere's a link to a story Si Cantwell wrote when Jennings wrapped up\nhis career: \n\n\n\nhttp://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20100525/ARTICLES/100529711?Title=Here-Now-WAAV-waves-goodbye-to-longtime-radio-host\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
