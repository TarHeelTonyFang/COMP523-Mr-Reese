{"title": "I had previously submitted a question and never received a response.  This has happened before -- I do get the auto response that the question would be answered within 24 hours or so, but there was no information after that.\n\n\n\nMy question was about the construction of the new super VA clinic.  Has construction begun, is it on the right side of the drive into the airport where work is going on now, and when is it expected to be completed?\n\n\n\nI can\\'t tell if there is a problem with my computer at work communicating with you, or what the problem could be.  I\\'d love to know the answer to my question, though, as my son will be using the clinic.\n\n\n\nPlease e-mail a reply so I know you really received the question.  Thanks!", "text": " \n\nI sent you an e-mail earlier in response.
