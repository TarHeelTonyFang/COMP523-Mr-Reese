{"title": "What kinds of poisonous snakes are in the waterways/lakes/ponds around Wilmington? Is there a posting to warn the public from swimming in such waters?", "text": "  The\ncottonmouth moccasin is the most common venomous snake found in local\nwaters. I've never seen a sign warning of snakes in the water, but I\nhave seen signs warning of alligators.\n\n\n\nHere's a link to a story I wrote a few years back:\nhttp://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20070907/NEWS/709070317?p=all&tc=pgall\n\n\n\nIt provides an overview of common poisonous snakes found in the\nregion.\n\n\n\nThanks again for writing to MyReporter.com."}
