{"title": "What happened to the Dragon Garden restaurant at University Landing on College Road within the Lowes Foods Plaza? My wife and I went there over the weekend and they were closed with a notice from the Sheriff\\'s Dept. on the door.", "text": "  \n\nOur calls are not being returned from the former owners, so we can't\ntell you why it was closed. But the notice you saw is not the city or\npolice shutting down the restaurant. Those notices are often put up on\nclosed businesses that say a building is not in use."}
