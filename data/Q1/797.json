{"title": "IS IT POSSIBLE AT LOW TIDE TO DRIVE ALL THE WAY TO BALDHEAD IN A JEEP?  ANYONE OUT THERE DONE IT?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nI've driven to the end of the Fort Fisher 4-wheel-drive access,\nwhere it meets Bald Head Island. There are posts in the ground there\nto prevent vehicle traffic beyond that point. Also, there are signs\nthere saying it's a nature conservancy and vehicles aren't allowed.\n\n\n\nWhile I was there one day, a couple walked up from their vacation\ncottage at Bald Head.\n\n\n\nSo, yes, you COULD drive to Bald Head, but it's not allowed.\n\n\n\nI hope that answers your question.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
