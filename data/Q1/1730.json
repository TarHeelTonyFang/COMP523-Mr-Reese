{"title": "The recent winner of the Powerball in Ashville took the lump sum payout. Why was there such a difference in the actual winnings to the actual payout?", "text": "  \n\nLottery winnings are taxable income, so taxes are taken out of the\nlump sum payout. If the winner elects to take an annual installment,\ntaxes are paid out over the period of the annuity, usually 30 years.\nSince the taxes are not taken out in a lump sum, the annuity provides\nmore money over time.\n\nHere's an example at this site:\n\nhttp://www.usamega.com/powerball-jackpot.asp\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
