{"title": "Where are some good bike paths/places to bike in the area?", "text": "Earlier this summer I set out to ride all the designated bike routes\nin the area.\n\n\n\nFrom my experience, All the routes have good parts and bad parts. And\ndepending on what you're trying to do, bikers can pick and choose the\nparts they feel comfortable with.\n\n\n\nI totally enjoyed the part of The River-to-Sea trail that goes\nthrough Wilmington's old trolley neighborhood along Park Avenue, then\ndown a real bike path with no traffic and then through the old Delgado\nMill neighborhood. Even the county's web site, however, has\ncautionary notices on other parts of the trail such as dangerous\ncrossings at Third Street and Dawson Street and high traffic volume\nalong Oleander Drive.\n\n\n\nMy best advice is to take a look at the trails on these Web sites and\nchoose a route that look safe to you. You can also contact avid\nbicyclists through the first two links who can give you first-hand\ntips for riding in the area.\n\nhttp://www.capefearcyclists.org/\n\nhttp://www.sirbikesalot.com\n\nhttp://www.nhcgov.com/AgnAndDpt/PLNG/Pages/BAC.aspx\n\n\n\nAlso, if you're into mountain biking, hands down the best place to\ngo is Blue Clay Bike Park off Blue Clay Road beside the New Hanover\nCounty Sheriff's Office, 3950 Juvenile Center Road.\n\nThat park offers miles of trails through woods with obstacles to jump\nover and bike through."}
