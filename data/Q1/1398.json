{"title": "I just moved to Sunset Beach, NC 28468 to help care for my almost 88 yr. old mother. Is the new sewer project really intimidation? Each homeowner on the mainland is being charged $8,000? Mom said that at a meeting someone mentioned floating a bond ref.and they were told it couldn\\'t be done. Why? I remember back in the 50\\'s the government helped rural or small communities to obtain water and sewer. Today she was told by an engineer that she would have a lien put against her home. What is going on behind this project. Are low income people being chased out?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nWe have no reason to think it's intimidation, but I've reached out\nto a reporter with your concerns.
