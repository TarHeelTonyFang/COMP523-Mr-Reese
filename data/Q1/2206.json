{"title": "Is there anyone who can stop this kind of greed at the gas company?\n\nMy mother\\'s natural gas company requires that she purchase a full tank of gas. The giant, full tank cost $1,000 (+ or - taxes). This bill is usually paid in two payments. Mom has been with this co. (which used to be B&R)about five years. A delivery will not be made if she has a balance due.  If there\\'s no bal., she is required to order at least a half tank with an addidtional fee added when less than a full tank is delivered.\n\n Mother is an 80+ senior. Pays her bills soon after they\\'re received. We feel it\\'s time to search for another company, soon! Will they have the same rules and restrictions ... cost$$$\n\nThank you.\n\n   ", "text": "  Here\nis a link to the public staff of the state utilites commission, which\nregulates natural gas services.\n\nhttp://www.pubstaff.commerce.state.nc.us/pscons/pscons.htm\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
