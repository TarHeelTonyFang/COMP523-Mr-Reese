{"title": "What in tha hell is going on with RC Soles and why in the world is it not on star news front page everyday until he answers questions concerning his boytoy?? i guess?? Who is in charge around there??  I guess WWAY is the only REAL,cutting edge news source in S.E. North Carolina. Why don\\'t you find out why he has been unavailible for comment ever since this story broke?  He\\'s a public servent for crying out loud...he has to be made availible to his constituents.  Y\\'all would\\'t know a juicy story if it bit you on the ass! WAKE UP, INVESTIGATE, REPORT!!! -Brian A.", "text": " \n\n\n\nOur managing editor Julie Martin (343-2383 or\njulie.martin@starnewsonline.com) tells me that the StarNews has a\nreporter in Raleigh looking into the story. When they have the story,\nthey'll have it in the StarNews. But you're right that WWAY is doing\na good job of putting pressure on Mr. Soles to answer his\nconstituents. I as well look forward to our paper getting the news to\nreaders about what may or may not be going on in this matter. If\nyou'd like to discuss this further with our executive editor Roybn\nTomlin, her email is robyn.tomlin@starnewsonline.com. Thanks for using\nMyReporter.com."}
