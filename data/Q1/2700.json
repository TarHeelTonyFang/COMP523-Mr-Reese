{"title": "How many high level retirees from UNCW have returned to work at 50% of their 6 figure salary plus their retirement pay?\n\nThis should be the start of an investigation of all the waste and shenanigans that go on at UNCW. Here\\'s the policy. These people should be publicly exposed.\n\n\n\nIf you return to employment with an employer that does participate in the Retirement System from which you retired, the following information applies after October 1, 2005: A six-month period during which no service (except as an unpaid bona fide volunteer at a school) is rendered to an employer in the Teachers\u00e4\u00f3\u00bb and State Employees\u00e4\u00f3\u00bb Retirement System (TSERS) must immediately precede a return to employment. A return to work earlier than six months will revoke your retirement benefit retroactively to your retirement date and all benefits paid to you must be repaid to the Retirement System. Establishing a pre-existing agreement for post-retirement employment with an employer in TSERS is prohibited and could cause retroactive revocation of retirement benefits, as well.\n\n\n\nIf you are reemployed by, or otherwise engaged to perform services for, a TSERS-covered employer after six months from your retirement date in a position not eligible for participation in TSERS, you will be subject to earnings restrictions of 50% of your gross 12-month pre-retirement salary (excluding termination payments) or $29,280 (2011 amount), whichever is higher. The dollar figure is adjusted annually according to the Consumer Price Index, which is a national measure of increase in the cost of living from one year to the next. These earnings restrictions apply for the 12 months immediately following retirement and for each calendar year following the year of retirement.", "text": "  Here's a link to the answer to your question.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=11450\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
