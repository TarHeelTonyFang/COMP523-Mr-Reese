{"title": "I read the article in today\\'s paper on line about the increase in Loggerhead turtle nests at Topsail Island. I am aware, from my own first hand knowledge that Bald Head also had a record nesting year for loggerheads as well. I read that the naturalist Beasley, I believe, at Topsail felt that their conservation efforts were having a positive effect on the turtle population. I\\'d like to know if that is true. My question is could you talk to the folks at Topsail and Bald Head, consult a local scientist and have him or her render an opinion as to whether these effects/data are significant and represent improvement?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nYour question has been forwarded to the editor who handled the turtle\nstory.
