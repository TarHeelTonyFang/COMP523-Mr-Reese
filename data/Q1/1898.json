{"title": "I live in the Ogden area and use Ogden Park Drive daily. It is a popular street to use to get into Ogden Park and the communities that surround Ogden Park. Why isn\\'t there a traffic light here? There is a lot of congestion, especially in the summer.  When someone wants to make a left turn onto Market Street coming from the park (there is no left turn lane) traffic backs up on Ogden Drive all the way back to the park!\n\nAre there any plans for installing a light on this dangerous street to Ogden Park!\n\n\n\nThanks for your insight into this matter.", "text": "  \n\nThere are no plans currently for your request, but as with all\ntraffic questions we get, we urge you to contact the NCDOT about your\nrequest. If others are also seeing a problem, more requests may get\nthe issue resolved. Thanks,\n\n\n\n"}
