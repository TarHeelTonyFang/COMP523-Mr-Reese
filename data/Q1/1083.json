{"title": " I took a gallon of water to CFCC to be tested with the new equipment that was purchased by the college with $150,000 of grant money and have called the lead instructor of the Chem Tech program, Tracy Holbrook, several times with no reply....did the testing program end before my sample, that was submitted on March 21, was tested?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nThe following is from Tracy Holbrook of CFCC:\n\n\n\nWe recieved over 200 water samples this semester, almost doubling the\namount when have typically received in the past.  Due to the high\nnumber, it is taking longer than expected to complete the tests on\nevery sample.  Your sample was assigned to one of our students who\nshould have followed up with you concerning the delay. \n\n\n\nCurrently, our last year students have graduated and the returning\nfirst year students will be taking our summer course.  During the\nsummer semester, the water study will be completed, and results are\nexpected during the last week of May.  We are now on summer break, and\nwill return next week.  If you are interested in what we have\ncurrently found in your water sample, please let me know and when I\nreturn, will look your data up.\n\n\n\nSorry for the delay!\n\n\n\nTracy\n\n\n\nTracy L.
