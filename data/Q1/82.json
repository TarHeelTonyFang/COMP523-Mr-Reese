{"title": "I would like to know more about African American businesses before and during the 1898 Race Riots in Wilmington NC. One in particular was located on 8th and Nixon Street  Northside of town (Proprietor Joe Nick Byrd). I have been told that the building was eventually purchased from him by a Mr. Watson Clardy. I have also been told that the possible names of this restaurant was 1) Nik\\'s Restaurant 2) Byrd\\'s Restaurant . Business Liscences for this gentleman?? impact with the community?? Any information would be EXTREMELY helpful.\n\nHelpful info; Oldest daughter was born in 1914 so i\\'m thinking the restaurant was up and running prior to that. \n\n", "text": " \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, your question goes beyond the scope and intent of\nMyReporter.com.
