{"title": "New to NC and can\\'t for the life of me figure out the designations of NW, SW, N, SE etc on some street names.  There seems to be no rhyme nor reason for them. ????", "text": " \n\n\n\nFrom my experience here, those designations are in relation to a main\nroad. For example, Wilmington streets north of Market Street carry the\nnorth designation, while streets south of Market carry the south\ndesignation.\n\n\n\nIn Brunswick County, you'll see those same designations along U.S.\n17 or other major highways.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
