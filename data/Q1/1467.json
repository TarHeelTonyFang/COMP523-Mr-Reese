It suddenly disappeared about a quarter of the way into the contest period from your website and the only way to continue to view/vote was to Google it outside of the StarNews.  \n\n\n\nNot even a search on your site produces the link.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n", "text": "  \n\n\n\nYou can still view the photo submissions and now see the winners at http://www.starnewsonline.com/holidayphotos. \n\n\n\nIf you have any problems accessing that URL, you can also go directly to http://starnewsonline.upickem.net/engine/Welcome.aspx?contestid=198992."}
