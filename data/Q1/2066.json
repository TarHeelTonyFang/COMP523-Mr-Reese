{"title": "Do you know if there is anywhere on the net, that I can look up a 1965 Obituary, for free? I had the Star News write up, for many many years, but through moving, etc. I can\\'t find it.This person was my very best friend and became my sister-in-law. She died in July 1965.\n\nThank you so much, for any help, you can give me. This is very important to me.\n\n      Many Thanks, Daphne", "text": "  \n\nWe're sorry to say this but you can't find an electronic version\nanywhere online for a 1965 obit at the StarNews. But you can check at\nthe New Hanover County Library. They have StarNews issues back to that\ndate, and since you have the actual date you could look it up and\nprint a copy. Hope this helps!"}
