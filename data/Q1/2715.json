{"title": "After buying tickets for a concert at the Brooklyn Arts Center at St. Andrews, we discovered that there is no seating downstairs and no elevator. As two partially handicapped senior citizens, we were not sure if we could attend or not.  There is no information on the web site about this.  I called and e-mailed the Center, and Rich, the general manager, called me back.  He said that there was a ramp on the side and we could bring our wheelchair.  He also said that there were benches around the back of the space, but that he would make sure that we had a chair to go with our wheelchair.  I suggested to him that, like many other concert venues, information should be made available on the web-site, etc. re handicapped access and seating.  I thought that there was a law or ordinance that required not only handicapped access, but notification of availability.  Am I correct ?
