{"title": "I live in the Waterford  Walmart area of Hwy 17 South.  I can\\'t find a safe intersection or area that a pedestrian or a wheelchaired person can safely cross this highway.  I must drive from Waterford or Magnolia Greens  if I want to visit any business across  17S such as Walmart, Applebees or even one of the professional offices on the walmart side.                                   Are there any future plans for a way to safely cross 17S in this area?
