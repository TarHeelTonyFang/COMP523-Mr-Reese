{"title": "Is there a way to have Waste Management allow recycing in multiple unit dwellings on a case by case basis in Brunswick County?  I can understand apartment complexes having a common dumpster used for recycling only, but I live in a six-unit townhouse in Windsor Park.  We already have regular trash pickup (with individual cans assigned to the home), but no recycling.  Because of not having a bin, most of my neighbors just throw recycleables away!\n\n\n\nThe truck would make ONE stop and pick up 12 bins (there is also a six-unit structure across the street) whereas that same truck would have to make 12 stops at single-family homes to pick up the equivalent number of bins.  The economics just do not make sense to ban ALL multiple-family dwellings.  \n\n\n\n", "text": "  Have\nyou tried contacting Waste Management about your recycling bin\nsuggestion?"}
