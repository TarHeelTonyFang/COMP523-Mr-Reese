{"title": "What big name stores will be added (and when)to the Home Depot shopping area in Monkey Junction? Please say a Target!", "text": "  \n\nSorry, but we checked with Target a few months ago and there are no\nplans for a new Wilmington location. Of course, that can all change --\nsite plans can be subject to retooling at any time.\n\nOur retails reporter Judy Royal is working on a column about all the\nnew stores coming to the area, and will include the Monkey Junction\narea in her report. Because of how much work will be involved, she is\nworking toward the third Friday in September. Her column is called\nRetail Details. Thanks!"}
