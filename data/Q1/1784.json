{"title": "How did motorists cross the Cape Fear River prior to the opening of the Memorial Bridge in October 1969?", "text": "  \n\nPrior to the Memorial Bridge opening, access between Wilmington and\nBrunswick County was provided by a pair of two-lane, low-rise bridges\n_ the first crossing the Northeast Cape Fear River just south of the\ncurrent Isabel Holmes Bridge and the other the Cape Fear River just\nsouth of the current Cape Fear Memorial Bridge. If you look on the\nwest side of the river, you can still see where the old road ended and\nsome old pilings where the old bridge was located.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
