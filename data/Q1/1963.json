{"title": "What is the possibility of the DMV mandating tags for scooters or revising the current law to state scooters may only travel on roads that have a posted spped limit of 35mph or less?\n\n\n\nBecause scooters cost so little, thee are (I would guess) well over a thousand on the roads in Wilmingotn.\n\n\n\nThey are an inherent risk to other drivers due to the low speeds the scooter travels.\n\n\n\nSeveral, several times on Shipyard Blvd (which is a 50 mph zone) I have witnessed cars slamming on brakes to avoid hitting a scooter that was traveling 35mph or less.\n\n\n\nWhat can be done about the problem and what are the current laws regarding operating a scooter? May someone with a revoked license due to a DUI conviction still operate the motor scooter?", "text": "  \n\nThis is really more of an opinion or observation than a question.\nThere aren't any current considerations to change scooter laws that\nare pending.
