{"title": "If approved, the newly proposed senior housing project (LRS) is just one in a recent wave of construction effecting [south] Masonboro Loop Rd traffic.  Has anyone calculated the effects of the new/proposed construction on Myrtle Grove, Masonboro Loop, and Piner Roads?  Since construction of the Helms Port community, traffic patterns have already degraded.  These other constructions will add hundreds of new residents to this already constricted area.", "text": "  We are doing an ongoing series on traffic issues in the area called Operation Gridlock in cooperation with WWAY TV. I've forwarded your question to the editor in charge of that series. When a story results, it will appear at StarNewsOnline.com and in the StarNews.\n\n\n\n"}
