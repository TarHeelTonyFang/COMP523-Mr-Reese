{"title": "My 90 yr young cousin is looking to contact an old friend of hers.  Shirley McCluskey Sims or Simms.  Sally hasn\\'t heard from her in about 3 years and wonders how she is.  Her son, Carson, teaches at a university in Costa Rica.\n\nI\\'ve not found an obituary so I\\'m hoping that Shirley\\'s still alive and kicking.  She\\'ll be 86 this month.  Sally thinks she may have moved to Costa Rica.\n\nAny help greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks.\n\nB.
