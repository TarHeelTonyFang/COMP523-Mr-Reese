Will the feature be returned to this newer format?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nYes, that feature will be returned.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, however, you can search it like this:\n\n\n\nhttp://mugshots.starnewsonline.com/?s=FirstName+LastName\n\n\n\nSo, anything after s= are your search terms with + signs where you\nwould have spaces. See if that works for you.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
