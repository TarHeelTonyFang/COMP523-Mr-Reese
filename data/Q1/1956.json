{"title": "Why does the city continue to \\'top\\' the oak trees downtown, and are there other companies other than \\'Asphlunt\\' that have submitted bids to do the work? The pruning style is called \\'angel wings\\' (according to the arborist we hired to verify that it was a destructive pruning job.)  \\'Asphlunt\\' seems to do the less than stellar job of \\'trimming\\' low limbs, limbs near power lines, etc. They continually do improper cuts that invite infection and disease. They cut too many limbs. If you look at the trees downtown, look up. You will notice that many trees are not much more than a stump w/ a few limbs left low. It\\'s gross. Are there competitive bids submitted for the job? Has the city considered burying the power lines in order to save the trees?", "text": "  \n\nThis is probably a little more involved than I'd normally address in\na MyReporter question, but it's an interesting question and I'm\ngoing to pass it along to our city government reporter as a story\nidea.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
