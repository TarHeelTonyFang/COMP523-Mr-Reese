{"title": "As a child I went to Empie Park and played in the castle on a few occassions. For reasons unknown to me we never thought to take pictures.  I have been searching for sometime for a picture of that awesome castle.  Do you have one or can you tell me how to find one. Thank you. \n\n\n\nSummer", "text": "  I\nwasn't able to find a photo of the Empie Park castle in our archives\nor the online archives of the New Hanover County Public Library.\nHowever, the library might have other photos that have not yet been\nscanned into the online archives. You might check with the local\nhistory librarian.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
