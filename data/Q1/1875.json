{"title": "Since the StarNews Online has started showing mugshots, I\\'ve noticed that not everyone who is arrested has their photo displayed.  Who decides which mugshots appear and which ones don\\'t?  Or is it a matter of having an attorney keep it from being publicized?", "text": "  \n\nThe photos come directly from the New Hanover County Sheriff's\nOffice bookings and include any person who is booked at the jail\nthere. If someone is booked at another jail in the area, we do not\nhave direct feeds of mug shots from them. If you have other questions,\nyou can contact Joel Axon, our online editor, at\nJoel.Axon@StarNewsOnline.com\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
