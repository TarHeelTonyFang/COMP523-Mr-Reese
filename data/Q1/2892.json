{"title": "What is the deal with the traffic light at Market St and 3rd St? There used to be a turn arrow for motorists that were heading west on Market St and were wanting to turn south onto 3rd St. The turn signal was turned off when the road work commenced on 3rd St, but it has never been turned back on and the work in the immediate area of the intersection seems to have been completed. Will it ever be turned on again? I make this turn several times a day and all too many times have sat through multiple cycles of the light before being able to make that turn with traffic on Market St backing up past 4th St. This can\\'t safe, wise, and or efficient as this is forcing traffic to reroute itself through the smaller downtown neighborhood streets, around 4th and Market, were several churches and schools reside.", "text": "  Here's a link to the answer to your question.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=12487\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
