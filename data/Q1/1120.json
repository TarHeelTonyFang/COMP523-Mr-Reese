{"title": "Why has the Best Seller List in the Sunday newspaer been so illegible the past two weeks?  (Last week, it was absolutely unreadable even using a magnifying glass!)  What in the world is the problem???????????", "text": "  \n\n\n\nThe smaller type is a result of a change by the New York Times, which\nsupplies the list to the StarNews. Recently the print and e-book lists\nwere combined, resulting in more information in about the same space.\nWe receive the list as an image (like a photograph) instead of text,\nmeaning we can only make the whole list wider and deeper to increase\nthe size of the print, resulting in lost space on the page. We're\nlooking into ways to solve this problem.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
