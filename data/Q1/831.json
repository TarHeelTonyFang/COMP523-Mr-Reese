{"title": "Why does Aqua let the water run in the street and down the drains when it releases the water from a fire hydrant? Can\\'t this water be captured and put to another use? ", "text": "  \n\n\n\nIt depends if what you saw was a deliberate attempt to flush out a\nsewer line, which can be done. Also, if there was something lodged\ninside (rocks and other material can build up), it would need to be\nflushed until this came out. Could they use the water for other\nthings? Sure, but trying to capture and transport this flushed water\nwould likely create additional costs for the city/county.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
