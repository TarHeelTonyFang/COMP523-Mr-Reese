{"title": "I have one page of your newspaper/website dated February 8, 2007.  It's a full page aerial view of my street after the tornado with my house at the bottom center.  I obviously did not live here at the time.  Was there any other coverage of this tornado?  I'm tutoring 5th grade math at a local elementary school and they are building and testing model houses for wind and water resistance.  Any help or response would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you,\n\nMaureen Dimmer ", "text": "  We don't have any coverage of a tornado in The Villages as we cover Southeastern North Carolina, but here's a link to coverage we have of a tornado around the same time in our coverage area:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=riegelwood+tornado+site%3Astarnewsonline.com&rlz=1C1GGGE___US519US519&oq=riegelwood+tornado+site%3Astarnewsonline.com&aqs=chrome..69i57.7831j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=riegelwood+tornado+site:starnewsonline.com&start=10&*\n\n\n\nYou could try contacting the Ocala StarBanner to see if they covered the tornado you're writing about.
