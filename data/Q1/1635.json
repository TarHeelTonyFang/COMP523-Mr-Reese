{"title": "What ever happened with the Clarence Stowers lawsuit against Kohl\\'s for the finger-custard incident?", "text": "  \n\nHere's your answer, from court reporter Veronica Gonzalez:\n\nA Wilmington man who bit down on a severed fingertip when he slurped\ndown a mouthful of frozen chocalate custard dismissed his lawsuit\nagainst Kohl's Frozen Custard on Oct. 23, 2006.\n\nClarence Stowers sued Kohl\u00cds Frozen Custard on College, Inc., Kohl\u00cds\nFrozen Custard, Inc., and the Carvel Corp. on Sept. 22, 2005 in New\nHanover County, claiming those companies were negligent and that he\nsuffered psychological damage. He claimed they had failed to properly\ntrain employees and operated a machine without guardrails that had\npreviously severed another employee's finger.\n\nThe lawsuit stemmed from when Stowers bought a pint of  frozen\nchocolate custard at the drive-in window of the Kohl\u00cds Frozen Custard\noutlet that used to be located at 620 S. College Road. He took it home\nand dug in only to discover the severed fingertip.\n\nThe missing digit belonged to 23-year-old Brandon Fizer, once a\nmanager of the Kohl\u00cds outlet. His right index finger was accidentally\namputated at the first knuckle in a custard-mixing machine. Restaurant\nemployees looking for the finger to have it reattached weren\u00cdt aware\nit had already left the property in a freshly-packed pint.\n\nStowers returned to the business about 30 minutes later with the\nfingertip, but refused to return it.\n\n\n\nAfter the incident, Stowers told news media the chunk in the custard\nlooked like candy, so he put it in his mouth, sucked the custard off\nand then spit it out. While washing it off in the kitchen sink, he\nnoticed it was a human finger and began screaming. He later retained\nan attorney.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
