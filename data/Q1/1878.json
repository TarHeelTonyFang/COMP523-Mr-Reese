{"title": "I noticed again this week that the roadsides along Hwy 17 had been mown. It was obvious that litter of all kinds had been mown over creating a big mess,paper,plastic etc. strewn everywhere. In other places orange bags of trash were waiting to be picked up. My question is why is this not planned better,mow after trash clean up,to avoid this mess? Who is in charge?", "text": "  \n\nThe responsibilities lie with the NCDOT. Oftentimes, we're told, the\nschedule doesn't mesh with the rate of grass growth. This means the\ngrass gets too high to go through looking for trash, much of which was\nlittered during the first day it was cut. After a cut, if there is\nlitter, the NCDOT will return for trash pickup."}
