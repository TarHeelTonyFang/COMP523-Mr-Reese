{"title": "WHERE IS BENJAMIN CHAVIS TODAY.  THE ARTICLE DID NOT SAY.", "text": "Chavis isn't a Wilmington man. MyReporter uses its resources to\nreport on life in Southeastern North Carolina, which we define as\nBrunswick, New Hanover and Pender counties.\n\nThat said, Wikipedia has this to say:\n\nToday Dr. Chavis is no longer connected with the Nation of Islam. He\nworks with Inter-Faith efforts as well as ecumenical movements to\nestablish better levels of understanding among Christians, Jews, and\nMuslims."}
