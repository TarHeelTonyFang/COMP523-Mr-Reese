{"title": "How far back does the search on the Star News search?  Where can I perform a search in an effort to locate articles that were printed many years ago?", "text": "  \n\nYou can do searches on our current site back to 2002, searching by\ntopic or date. (At the bottom left section of our home page, click on\nNews Archives and you can search by year.) For older copies, the New\nHanover County Public Library and UNCW library have archived copies on\nmicrofilm.\n\nAlso, there is a Google newspaper archive that has some material from\nolder issues, but it isn't complete and I haven't found anything on\nit older than about 1980. You can search under Wilmington Morning Star\nor Star-News. Please note this is a Google site and is not run by us.\nHere's the link:\n\nhttp://news.google.com/archivesearch/advanced_search\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
