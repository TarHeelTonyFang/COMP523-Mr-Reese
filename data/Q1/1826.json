{"title": "In todays paper on page 1B was an article about an Attorney found guilty of trying to hide money from the IRS.  The article said he had reported the income and paid the taxes.  Since when is it a crime not to tell the IRS where my money is? I always thought that once I reported the income and paid the taxes, I could do anything I wanted with the remainder.  Was there something not made clear in the story? It reads like Big Brother is watching and you better not draw the blinds.  ", "text": "  \n\nThat story was a wire story that came from the Associated Press out\nof Raleigh, so I can't tell you specifics, but after reading it I\nwould assume that it's because he paid a lower tax rate. While he did\nreport the smaller sums in each bank, because it's not accounted as\none set amount, he paid taxes on the individual accounts, most likely\nat a lower tax rate."}
