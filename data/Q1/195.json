{"title": "The Rocky Point 117 intersection at Paul\\'s place why do the people driving South 117 have to yield for the traffic driving North turning left on 133? This is very confusing both ways. Some people turning left wait on the people turning right. Why don\\'t the people turning right have the right away. Why don\\'t they just put up a signal with a turn arrow to make it a safer intersection just asking.", "text": " \nLooking at Google Street View photos of that intersection, it appears\nthere are fairly new traffic signals that would take care of the\nproblem you describe."}
