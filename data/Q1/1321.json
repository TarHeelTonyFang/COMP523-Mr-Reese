{"title": "I wonder why Carolina Treet is so invisible in the Wilmington community?\n\n\n\nI never see advertisements, and they never show their face at any of the Wilmington fairs or events...I find it strange.\n\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.carolinatreet.com/contact.asp", "text": "  \n\n\n\nUnfortunately that's a question we won't be answering. We commit\nour resources to answering questions of a local nature that aren't\npromotional. Since you already have the contact information for\nCarolina Tweet, I would suggest you give them a call.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
