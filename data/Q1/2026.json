{"title": "Why are the NC license plate display procedures ignored by law enforcement? \n\n\n\nI see a lot of month and year stickers on the wrong side of the plate, or year stickers on both sides of the plate. It would be impossible for police at a glance to tell if the plate is expired or not. It seems that it should be illegal to improperly display the plate.\n\nIt also gives law enforcement the reason to stop a vehicle whereby other violations are often discovered.\n\n \n\nIt is not difficult to place these in the proper place to be legal. \n\nFor those who can read and follow instructions, it\\'s printed right on the registration card.", "text": "  \n\nWe primarily focus here on things that are specific to southeastern\nNorth Carolina. This is a little too far afield.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
