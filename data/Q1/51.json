That doesn't always happen for various reasons,\nsuch as the inability to reach a source or breaking news that might\ninvolve the reporter assigned to answer the question.\n\n\n\nWe endeavor to answer most questions, either through reporting or\nthrough links to previously answered questions or stories. \n\n\n\nThe focus of MyReporter.com is answering questions about life in\nCoastal North Carolina. That's where we devote our resources. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
