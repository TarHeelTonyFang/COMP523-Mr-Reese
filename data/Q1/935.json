{"title": "Why do newspapers like to print the age of persons named in the paper?  Why is that relevant to a story?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nOf course age is relevant to many stories. It's part of description\nof a person. In some stories, it's more relevant than others. \n\nFor example, if someone graduates from college at age 21, it's not\nunusual. But if they graduate at age 80, that's entirely different. \n\nFor another example, age is relevant in all sorts of legal and\ncriminal matters, such as whether someone is tried as a juvenile or an\nadult, or whether they are of legal drinking age, or able to sign a\ncontract on their own.\n\nThere are all sorts of other reasons age is relevant to stories as\nwell.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
