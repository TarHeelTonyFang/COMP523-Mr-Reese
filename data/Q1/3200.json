{"title": "I wrote to you a couple months ago with the question;  Do you know where I might find some drawings/schematics of the Liberty Ships.  Doesn\\'t make any difference what the ships name is.  Or maybe some of your readers might know. But the SS Noonday would be nice s my mother christened that ship.  Thank you.", "text": "Earl ,\n\n\n\nI found this link to a page that specifically mentions the SS\nNoonday: http://ncccha.blogspot.com/2010/08/uss-caswell-aka-72.html\n\n\n\nAlso, I had earlier sent you a link to the New Hanover County Public\nLibrary\u00e4\u00f3\u00bbs Digital Archives, which contain several photos of the\nLiberty Ships: http://cdm15169.contentdm.oclc.org/index.php\n\n\n\nYou can use the search function on the library website to find the\nphotos.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
