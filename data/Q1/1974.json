{"title": "What can the county do to help boaters at Trails End Boat Ramp?\n\nOn any given weekend, over half of the cars parked are NOT attached to a trailer. This means with such limited parking as it is, the lot gets jammed with boaters trying to get in and out with their boats & trailers, and get caught up because of the non-trailer toting cars blocking the turn-about. The issue there is not with the boaters. Every boater I have seen is polite and respectful of all the other boaters. It is the passenger cars, without trailers, parking in spots meant for vehicles with trailers that is the problem. Can the county limit cars without trailers so the boat ramp can be used by boaters?\n\n\n\n", "text": "  \n\nThis probably isn't something we can readily answer with MyReporter,\nbut I will pass this along as a possible story idea.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
