{"title": "I\\'ve been a part time resident here for a couple of years now and have observed many Wave buses at different times of day and different locations and have never seen more than 4-5 people on one.  Mostly they seem to be empty.\n\n\n\nI\\'m curious as to what the answer would be if all annual costs associated with the Wave operation, both operating and financel costs, were divided by the total number of paying passengers.  My guess is that it would be an eye opening number.\n\n\n\nThanks", "text": " \nThanks for your comments.
