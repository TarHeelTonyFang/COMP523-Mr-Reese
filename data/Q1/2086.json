{"title": "I\\'m planning to move to the Wilmington area in the near future from Massachusetts.  What kinds of critters and snakes are most common that I can expect to see in my backyard and what kinds of \\'man eating\\' insects can I expect to encounter regularly?  Who can tell me how to deal with the very pesky critters and insects?", "text": "  \n\nWelcome to Wilmington.\n\nProbably one of the peskiest insects you're likely to encounter in a\nlawn are fire ants, which build distinctive mounds, but they are\ncontrollable with treatments available at lawn and garden stores.\nMosquitoes are another favorite bug to complain about. As for snakes,\nthe ones that are poisonous are generally afraid of people and aren't\ncommon in developed neighborhoods. If you want detailed information on\nhandling garden pests, the Coopertative Extension Service is a good\nsource of information. The link to the website is included in one of\nthese entries.\n\nHere are some MyReporter links that might help:\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=4935\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=1172\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=2910\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=5973\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=5941\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=3742\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
