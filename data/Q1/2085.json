{"title": "What is the source of the horrible cat urine-like odor that sometimes permeates downtown?", "text": "  \n\nWe've looked into this question before, and what you're smelling is\na sweet mix of booze, mixed drinks, and yes, urine. As with most\ndowntown streets, that combo gives you a slightly different smell in\neach area, but alleys and sidewalks aren't cleaned thoroughly (or at\nall) so the odor stays. And if you're smelling cat urine in some\nareas, chances are it's cat urine."}
