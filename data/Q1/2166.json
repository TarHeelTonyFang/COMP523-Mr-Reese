{"title": "What ever became of the electric street cars/trolleys, steel tracks and railroad ties used on the Electric Beach Car Line that ran from 1902-1940.  My house was built in 1917 and stands less than 20 feet from where the tracks ran.  I have a small collection of railroad spikes I have found the past year while gardening and would love to track down (haha) a piece of the original track if possible.  Thank you so much!", "text": "  As it turns out, we've already answered most of your question.\nHere's a link to the answer to your question.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=847\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
