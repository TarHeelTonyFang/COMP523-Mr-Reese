{"title": "Do Brunswick County Sheriff K9 Deputies leave their dogs at home? Or do they bring them with them in the cars?\n\n", "text": " \nHere's your answer:\n\n\n\nThe Brunswick County Sheriff's Office's patrol dogs work closely\nwith their handlers. Not only do the human and K-9 law enforcers work\nthe same shifts - they also share a home. \n\nWhen the sheriff's office gets a dog, usually imported from\nCzechoslovakia, Holland and other parts of Europe, officials try to\nfit the dog with a handler based on personality matches, said 1st Sgt.\nTommy Tolley, who leads the K-9 unit. \n\nAfter going through an eight- to 10-week training course, the dogs go\nhome with their handler to create a bond. \n\nThe majority of the time, the dogs live with their handlers for their\nwhole lives. When the K-9 is about eight or 10 years old and ready for\nretirement, the handler is given the first option to keep the dog as a\npet, Tolley said. \n\nThe K-9s work 12-hour shifts with their handlers and are on call as\nneeded. They do everything from tracking missing children to sniffing\nout drugs.\n\nThey love going to work. They know when you have your uniform on  Tolley said. \n\nThe sheriff's office has eight patrol dogs and two bloodhounds named\nBonnie and Clyde. The bloodhounds, which were donated, are about 3\nmonths away from being ready to work. \n\nUnlike the other dogs, the bloodhounds are housed and taken care of\nat the sheriff's office. \n\nFor more information as well as bios and pictures of some of the\ndogs, go to\nhttp://www.brunswicksheriff.com/Home/Divisions/UniformServices/K9/tabid/671/Default.aspx"}
