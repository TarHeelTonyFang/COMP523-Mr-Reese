{"title": "Who is responsible for maintaining the areas along the City trail section between Oleander and Canterbury?  The area is full of litter and dead vegetation and has been for many months, even before Irene.  There are still some remnants of the construction such as stakes and tapes.

Thanks!", "text": "  Here's a link to the answer to your question.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=11929\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
