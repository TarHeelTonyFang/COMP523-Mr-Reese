Has it been considered for a farmers market?", "text": "  We\ncan tell you that years ago a number of locations were considered to\nhold what is now the downtown Farmers Market. Because many farmers at\nthe time were from across the bridge (and downtown is a central\nlocation) that spot was chosen.
