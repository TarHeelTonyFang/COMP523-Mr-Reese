{"title": "I subscribe to the digital format of the Star News.  What has happened to the crossword and sudoku section ?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nWe no longer host a crossword or other games on our website, but you can find the print versions in our eEdition at StarNewsOnline.com/eEdition (puzzles run in the back of the C section, before the classified ads).\n\n\n\nYou can also find the interactive versions of King Features puzzles (although not the New York Times crossword) online at http://puzzles.comicskingdom.com/.\n\n\n\nHope that helps!"}
