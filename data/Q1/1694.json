{"title": "If the gated community of St. James Plantation is now a town, why do they still have gates? Can there be a gated town?  I have heard that they want to annex the surrounding land. Even though the people annexed would pay taxes to St. James, they would not have access to anything inside of the gates. Is this true? Is this legal?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nCarrie\n\n\n\n", "text": "  \n\nIt's a village, not a town, which means those inside pay for the\nservices, and yes, it can have a gate. There is nothing moving forward\nconcerning alleged annexation, according to our reporter but if there\nis we'll report it. And yes, at that point I believe those annexed\nwould have access to the areas inside the gate."}
