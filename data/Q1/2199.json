{"title": "I live in the county. Progress energy recently cut back trees and bushes on the property line dividing our home from an empty wooded lot next door. Also there were vines twisting around the power lines up by the road, which they did not completely clear. They made a mess, and left it there at the front of our house. When I contacted them, I received an email stating it was my responsibility to clean up this mess. I am livid, as I just paid privately for debris to be cleared from my property days before Progress Energy made this mess. Can anyone help or tell me who to talk with at Progress Energy? \n\n", "text": "  Have\nyou tried contacting the N.C. Utilities Commission?
