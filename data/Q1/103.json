{"title": "What is the history behind this strange layout of roads near Hampstead? I came across them while looking for an address on Google Maps. \n\n\n\nCoordinates: 34.329054,-77.721409.", "text": " \n\nI'm not sure I can give you a definite answer. There are many roads\naround here that date back to roads that were cut through the woods\nback in horse and wagon days, including such things as logging roads,\nold farm roads and so forth. In addition, given the marshy nature of\nareas near the water, some old roads took rather odd routes to stay on\nhigh ground. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
