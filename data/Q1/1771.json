{"title": "There was a traumatic death in the Wilmington area this week and details are sketchy at best.  There has been NO news coverage that I can find.  A truck with lumber or maybe tresses had a load wider than 1 lane and the load ended up stricking and killing a pedestrian on the side of the road.  A very scary situation for pedestrians and bicycle riders in this community.  Why isn\\'t it in the news? Who is keeping it quiet?  Was it a big company that has pull to keep its name out of the news, or was it a private contractor who doesn\\'t want to get bad publicity?  I hope you can investigate.  Thanks ", "text": "  \n\nOur police reporter could find no such report regarding that death.\nIf this did happen, it was overlooked by our news team, not covered\nup. If you do have any details, please send them to\njim.ware@starnewsonline.com and we'll see what we can find out.\nThanks!"}
