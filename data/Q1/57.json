{"title": "My stepson is 24, lives at home with me in NC and wants to get a gun.  My response to him was;  He can get a permit and a gun as long as it is not stored in the house.  Of course it would be disrespectful of him, to go against my wishes.  But then most kids today know everything and are disrespectful when they do not get their way.  My son is no different.  \n\n\n\nSo how do I get him to abide with my wishes?  Are there any laws that he would be breaking by keeping it in the house.  Can I stop him from getting a gun till he moves out if he is not going to abide my my rules?  For those who say kick him out - please put some thought behind that, remember he is the one with the gun. lol", "text": " \n\n\n\nThank you for reading MyReporter.
