How much in terms of law enforcement, prison space, foregone tax base, etc.?  \n\n\n\n", "text": "  \n\nGetting a definitive number on the overall costs of fighting drugs is\ndifficult to pin down. But from the law enforcement standpoint, here\u00cds\na response from Charles Smith, the public information officer for the\nNew Hanover County Sheriff\u00cds Office:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u00cdm sure these numbers are not going to be as helpful as you wish but\nthey are budget numbers for the Detention Facility and Vice &\nNarcotics Divisions.  Obviously, the jail is used for other purposes\nthan the war on drugs.  The figures below represent salaries,\noperating and capital expenses.\n\n \n\nDetention Yearly Operating Budget - $ 14,903,167.00\n\nVice & Narcotics Yearly Operating Budget - $1,914,485.00\n\n \n\nCorporal Charles G.
