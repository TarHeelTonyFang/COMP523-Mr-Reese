{"title": " Just curious,\n\n\n\nBetween 5th ave & 4th street(on Wooster) new trees have been planted and a long vacant two story house has been demolished today. That would make two ajoining vacant lots clear.  Is there a new project in the making?\n\n\n\nThanks", "text": "  \n\nNeither the city of Wilmington nor the department of transportation\nhave any information on specific projects planned for the area,\nalthough the house was demolished.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
