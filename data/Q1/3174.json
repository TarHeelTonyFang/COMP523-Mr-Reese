We were told this from our manager in Radiology a few months ago...that we needed to blame the commissioners for not receiving this benefit this year.  Thanks", "text": "Christina,\n\n\n\nI've forwarded your question to Kate Elizabeth Queram, the reporter\nwho covers NHRMC, and Shannan Bowen, the reporter who covers the\ncounty commissioners.\n\n\n\nDo you have it in writing from your manager that employees should\nblame commissioners? If so, I'm sure Kate or Shannan would like to\nsee that.\n\n\n\nShould a story result from your question, it will appear at\nStarNewsOnline.com and in the StarNews.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
