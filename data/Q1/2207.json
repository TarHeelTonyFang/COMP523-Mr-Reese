{"title": "I think it was the NCDOT that came by last week on Covil Farms Road up in the Ogden area and dug up the grass (and in my case, my side yard) on both sides of the road from Old Fort Road in Gorman Plantation out to Military Cutoff.  I thought at the time maybe they were preparing for a bike lane (YEA!!)  Now they have sprayed that green grow grass quick stuff the whole way.  What have they done?  My side yard is a mess as they left chunks of dirt and grass as well as rocks and it sent water from that huge rainstorm last week through my back yard.  Anything I can do to make them at least fix the mess they have made?  Living on a corner, my husband and I work hard to maintain our property.  Needless to say we are not happy that a work crew can come along and do whatever they want with little care for what they have left behind.", "text": "  Here\nis a website and phone number for the regional DOT office.
