{"title": "Why did NO ONE IN ANY NEWS OUTLET notify the public of the impending arrival of 2 steel girders from the WTC???  The only reason I found out about it was the fact that I happened to be in the Mall when the escorts from FDNY retired came in.  This is PATHETIC!!!  Each and every one of the news outlets should be ashamed of the lack of coverage, especially since this is the 10th anniversary of the worst tragedy to strike the US in modern times.  Mayor Saffo should be especially ashamed of himself and his office at the lack of announcement for this momentous event.  We here in Wilmington are being HONORED with custodianship of not one but TWO pieces of national history that has forever altered us as a nation...and he couldn\\'t be bothered to let us KNOW ABOUT IT?!?!?  What a CROCK OF SH*T!!!!  He has once again succeeded in making us look like jackasses who don\\'t give a damn about anything...well, that may be true for him and his...but not for me.  I personally apologized to each and every one of the brave men who were there that day and who honored their fallen brothers today for the complete lack of respect our Great Mayor showed them...and I hope against hope that this will be remembered as the shame it is.", "text": "  \n\n\n\nI can't speak for other news outlets, but StarNewsOnline.com had\nthis:\n\n\n\nhttp://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20110607/ARTICLES/110609753\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
