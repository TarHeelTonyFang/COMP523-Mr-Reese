{"title": "Just wondering if there are any trick-or treat-times in New Hanover County?  We are new to the area and can\\'t find any info or any close places for my kids to trick-or-treat.  Everything is 40-45 minutes from us!  (We live in Pine Valley).  I already know about Independance Mall, but wanted to let them trick-or-treat outdoors, even trunk-or-treat, but can\\'t find anything remotely near us.  Any info would be greatly appreciated!", "text": "  Here are a couple of links to the answers to your question.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=3801\n\n\n\nhttp:/www.starnewsonline.com/halloween\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
