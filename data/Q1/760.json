{"title": "My wife and I purchased a home in the Wilmington city limits in 2006.  At that time, our bi-monthly combined water and gargage bill was approximately $65.  When Cape Fear Public Utility Authority took over these utilities, the price went up significantly and it seems to keep rising at a pace that greatly outstrips inflation.  Today, our bill is $104.  That\\'s about a 60% increase over the last four years.  I\\'m just curious to know how CPPUA justifies such large increases. What public body governs this organization and how much it can charge and how do they justify these increases.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, I\\'ve asked this question before through this website and it was never answered. I supposed the staff just got busy doing other things, which I understand, but if you could find out what\\'s going on with these substantial increases, I would appreciate it. I\\'m just searching for some answers.  When I asked CPPUA, I did not receive one.  \n\n\n\nMany thanks.\n\n\n\n ", "text": "  \n\n\n\nI think this recent series of stories at StarNewsOnline.com will\nanswer your questions:\nhttp://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20100627/ARTICLES/100629726\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
