{"title": "What ever happened to the former Laney H.S. Band director that was arrested for indecent liberties at a middle school in Mech County???  Richard Priode  (sp?)", "text": "  \n\nThe answer is nothing yet. As with all cases, it usually gets dragged\nthrough the courts at a rather slow pace. The StarNews will post an\nupdate when there is something new to report.\n\nHere's the info: On June 11, Richard Priode, 44, was charged by CMPD\nwith indecent liberties with a minor. Priode taught last year at\nSullivan Middle School in Rock Hill, but the alleged incident took\nplace in 2007, when Priode was band teacher at South Mecklenburg High\nSchool. He taught for two years at South Mecklenburg before leaving\nfor Rock Hill at the start of the 2008-09 academic year."}
