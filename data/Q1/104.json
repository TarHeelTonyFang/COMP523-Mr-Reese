{"title": "To avoid the maze of being passed from one phone extension to another with the County, the highway folks, and others, I\\'m seeking an answer to the question below.  \n\nWhat has happened to the community road signs for Springhill, Snowfield, and perhaps other Brunswick County communities?  Were they simply snatched from the grounds along Highway Seventeen south?  We knew they were always there, yet,one day in May, we noticed they were gone!\n\n\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n\n\nM. S. Moss ", "text": " \n\nI'm not sure I understand your question. Are you talking about\nstreet signs or signs at the entrances to subdivisions? If they are\nstreet signs, it would be the DOT's responsibility, but if they are\njust advertising the entrance to the subdivision, they would be the\nresponsibility of the property owners.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
