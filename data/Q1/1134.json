{"title": "I know that a North Carolina resident, who has moved from elsewhere, must change their vehicle license plates within a certain amount of time. (I believe it is within 30 days or possibly 3 months.)\n\nWho do you call or what do you do if you know that a neighbor, who has been living in the residence for longer than a year, has been driving a vehicle with license plates from another state. Or (same neighbor, different car) recently changed their North Carolina plates to South Carolina plates, but continue to reside full-time in Wilmington?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nThere are many reasons your neighbor may not have changed their\nlicense plate tags, including which state they claim residence in,\nregardless of where they live.\nhttp://www.ncdot.org/dmv/vehicle_services/registrationtitling/howToRegister.html\n\n\n\nBut, if you'd like to contact someone, it would be the NCDOT. This\noffice deals with licenses and theft. (910) 486-1331."}
