{"title": "Why doesn\\'t Wilmington maintain their medians.  Many of them look like overgrown vacant lots. Even ones in very prominent spots have chest high weeds and grass.

Most that\nwe know of are mowed and maintained, but not on a regular basis.\nContact City Hall about this complaint, and with others doing this as\nwell, action may be taken."}
