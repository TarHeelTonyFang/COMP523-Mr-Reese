{"title": "How does bond work? Is Allan Strickland posting cash for the full amounts of his bonds? If so, where has he gotten that kind of cash? Did he received cash from the insurance claim for his house fire?", "text": "  \n\nWe have not updated that story today, so can't tell you yet whether\n\nor not he will post a bond. If he does post bond with cash (which is\n\nrare), we wouldn't be able to find out how he got that kind of\nmoney,\n\nalthough we would try to find out. Regarding the insurance claim on\n\nthe house fire, it's very unlikely. Those payouts take months to\n\nfinalize, and seeing how he's now a suspect in the fire, it's very\n\nlikely he'll never see the money. But we'll stay on it."}
