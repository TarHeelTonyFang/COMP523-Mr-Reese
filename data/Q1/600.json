{"title": "Is there a source that lists and briefly describes organizations that are available to help the needy?\n\nWrightsville Beach magazine has a source on their website but it isn\\'t complete. They printed the list in one of their issues during the past year.\n\nThis source would also be valued by those with a medical problem looking for assistance. Volunteers could use the source to become aware of organizations that could use their help.\n\nWould the StarNews be interested in compiling such a source? If the source was available on line, it could be kept current. Periodically it could be printed and distributed through the StarNews.\n\nAs an aside, an article or series in the StarNews that followed a person or family that suddenly became homeless would be meaningful to many readers.", "text": "  \n\n\n\nI believe Living Local at StarNewsOnline.com is somewhat like the\nresource you suggested.
