Also what other stores will be filling the vacancies at the New Home Depot area in Monkey Junction?", "text": "  I\nhave done articles in the past about the Myrtle Grove shopping center\nand will get an update to you on anything coming soon. As far as the\nTarget, we have received a lot of questions about that and it doesn't\nseem to be coming anytime soon. However, we'll be doing a special\nRetail Details column in the coming weeks with a wish list of stores\nfor this area and what the companies say about the chances of them\nhappening.
