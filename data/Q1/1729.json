{"title": "Where can I buy fried peanuts in Wilington, Leland or Southport? I bought some while visiting in Wallace, and now my entire family is craving more.", "text": "  \n\nLiz Biro, who writes about cooking and dining, offered this:\n\nOftentimes, church groups make the blister-fried, shelled variety,\nand they turn up in the oddest places. I find that at independent gift\nstore and pharmacy\u00e6check outs and at convenience store check outs,\nmaybe even Eagle Island would sell them. They come in little glass\njars.\n\n\u00e6\n\nHere's a link to some companies that sell blister-fried peanuts:\n\nhttp://www.ncagr.gov/MARKETS/gginc/store/directory.asp?CatNum=1007&SubCatNum=5\n\n\u00e6\n\nAn in-the-shell fried peanut is available, too. Carolina's Peanuts\nused to sell them, but the Web site lists the store as temporarily\nclosed.\n\n\u00e6\n\nThis company sells them, and its lists a link to retail merchants and\nincludes a sales rep's name and number. Surely, he could list some\nplaces to buy:\n\nhttp://wallacesporkskins.com/defrpe.html\n\n\u00e6\n\nHope this info helps.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
