{"title": "Why, when there are major events in the area, are the stop light times not adjusted?  For example, this past Saturday, there were baseball games at Hugh MacRae along with the Earth Day festivities.  The exit to Huch MacRae Park on Pine Grove Road was closed off, forcing all exiting traffic to use the stoplight at College Road.  I certainly understand the reasoning for doing this, but why not have the College Road stoplight adjusted to allow more cars through the intersection?  It took me over an hour to leave the park on Saturday!  This occurance is not unusual.  It happens all over Wilmington when there are events and concerts.  Can someone with our traffic department review a list of area events and monitor traffic lights and cameras at peak times?  Other areas in the state do this regularly.", "text": "  Here's a link to the answer to your question.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=10486\n\n\n\n   "}
