{"title": "I know police presence on bicycles is noticed mostly in downtown Wilmington. But, what about other areas such as busy retail outlets? Property crimes are up significantly according to recent reports.", "text": "  \n\nBecause of the proximity from the station to downtown, police\nofficers there on bicycles make sense. One would guess that having\nthem patrol busy retail outlets would make sense, but MyReporter\nisn't able to change their patrol routes. Your best option is to\ncontact your local police station and ask to have areas of control\npatrolled. The more residents speak out about a particular area, the\nmore likely police will respond accordingly."}
