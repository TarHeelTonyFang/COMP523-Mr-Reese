Did the people responsible for making this decision even consider emergency vehicles having to reach a home on that street. Did they also consider making U turns at Nun Street could be somewhat dangerous.", "text": "  \n\nDue to the overwhelming amount of questions we get regarding traffic\nconcerns, we cannot answer certain specific questions. We ask that\nreaders direct these questions to the N.C. Department of\nTransportation at 910-251-5724. Thanks!"}
