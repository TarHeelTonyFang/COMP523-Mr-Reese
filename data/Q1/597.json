{"title": "I subscribed to Star News Online recently and am very confused. An email arrives with a sensational headline, followed by a box that asks if I want to subscribe, unsubscribe, tell a friend, give feedback, advertise or contact SN. I\\'ve already subscribed, obviously.. but no link in the email takes me to the headline story.  Very strange and frustrating... what is going on?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nI apologize for the inconvenience. We are looking into why the links\nto the stories are not appearing with the breaking news e-mail. We\nhope to have that issue corrected quickly.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
