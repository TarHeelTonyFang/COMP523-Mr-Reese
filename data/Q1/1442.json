{"title": "After reading the article today about the intersection adjustments at Masonboro Loop Road and Masonboro Sound Road, I wonder how the DOT will handle the problem for Masonboro Sound traffic during the hours of approximately 6:30-9:00 a.m.  Masonboro Loop traffic is backed up and currently,cars rarely come to a complete stop before turning left on Pine Grove.  If the Sound Road has a stop sign, traffic heading left toward Parsley Elementary School will never have the opportunity to turn due to the amount of traffic during the hours mentioned above.  What will be done to provide Masonboro Sound traffic an equal opportunity to turn or continue straight?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nWould you mind resubmitting your question as a comment on the\nMyReporter.com answer?
