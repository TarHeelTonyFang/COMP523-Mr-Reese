{"title": "What is being done to stop the increasing use of handicapped parking by people not entitled to use them ? Can anything be done to verify people who use handicapped parking that use someone elses permit ?", "text": " \n\n\n\nDo you have evidence to support your assertion that abuse of\nhandicapped parking is on the increase?\n\n\n\nBecause the guidelines for issuing handicapped placards or license\nplates allow for a broad range of disabilities, the reason for a\nperson using a placard or plate might not be obvious to police or the\ngeneral public.\n\n\n\nPlacards and plates are issued to specific people, so it is possible\nto verify if the person using the plate or placard is the person it\nwas issued to.\n\n\n\nDo police have time to randomly check parking violations? They say\nno"}
