{"title": "Why does it appear that the Wilmington Crime Map is not being updated?  I only see a couple of crimes in the downtown area.", "text": "  The crime map on StarNewsOnline.com operates as a feed from law enforcement. Unfortunately, the police and sheriff's office admit to having some issues with timely updates. We will seek an update on the problem. As soon as an answer is posted, we'll send you an email with a link to the answer."}
