{"title": "I have been researching the plan proposed by the County Fire Commission to consolidate the local volunteer fire service into the County Fire Department. While doing this research I have heard several rumors that the head of the independant consulting agency used to devise this plan was once a member of the County Fire Commission himself. I believe his name is Phil Cowie. I am already feeling a little rushed to form an informed decision on this topic since the Board of Commissioners is scheduled to vote Monday morning.  Odviously if this rumor is not true it could be very inflammatory and not something that I would want to promote.  I don\\'t think that I have the resources to find the truth and I wouldn\\'t know where to start if I did. Thank you in advance for taking the time to consider my question and I would really appriciate your input.", "text": "  \n\nThis is an ongoing story and I am passing this along to our reporter\nwho is covering it.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
