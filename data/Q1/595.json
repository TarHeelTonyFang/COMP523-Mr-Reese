{"title": "I work by the Vintage Values at Unvirsity Commons. I would like to know how they can throw away items that have been donated that are in perfect shape.Its truly sad to see people donating cloths and when they pull away it all gets thrown in the dumpster. Why not give them away to people that cannot afford to buy.I know I will not donate to this store for this reason.And I\\'m sure if people were made aware they would not either.\n\nThank you", "text": "  \n\n\n\nI apologize for the delay in answering your question.\n\n\n\nHere's a link to the answer to your question.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=9264\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
