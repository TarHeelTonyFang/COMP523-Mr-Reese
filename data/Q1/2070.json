It's built and updated\nby a company based out of Florida, and we're locked into it for the\ntime being. However, we are always open to suggestions by readers on\nhow to make it easier to navigate. Please send your comments to our\nweb director Joel Axon at joel.axon@starnewsonline.com and he will do\nhis best to try to make the pages better. Thanks"}
