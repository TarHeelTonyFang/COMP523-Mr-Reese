{"title": "during hurricane Matthew there was a picture of a pier with the water almost coming over the top and there looked like a man standing at the end of the pier.  Does anyone know if he got off ok.  I believe the pier was at Surf City or Oak Island\n\n", "text": "Assuming the attached photo is the one you are referencing, we aren't sure of the identify of the person on the pier but we have no reason to think he didn't walk off the pier just fine. There have been no reports of people missing or fatalities that would match the situation.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
