{"title": "I have family coming to visit from out of state. They would like to see as many revolutionary and civil war sites, as well as historic places in general. Is there a map somewhere or way to plan a historic site vacation in our general area?", "text": "  Here's a link to the answer to your question.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.cape-fear.nc.us/activities/wilmington/attractions.html\n\n\n\nYou can do this for each general area. We do not have one map of\nhistoric places, but a trip to the visitors bureau would provide maps\nof the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
