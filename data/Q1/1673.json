{"title": " Are there plans to meter the onramp to US 74-76 East going to Wilmington (the Causeway) from NC 133 North in Leland? By meter I mean control the flow of traffic from NC 133 onto the Causeway eastbound via a traffic light or some other means, perhaps by allowing a car or two onto the Causeway at 2 or 3 second intervals? This done in other states, and it seems to reduce the crunch of merging traffic from the ramp onto the Causeway. In fact, I thought I saw the NC-DOT actually test this by stationing a worker at the ramp who used a flag to control the flow.\n\n Thank you.", "text": "  \n\nI\u00cdm not quite sure I understand what you are asking, but this is the last update we had on the project\u00cds progress\n\nhttp://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20150813/ARTICLES/150819830/0/search\n\n\n\n"}
