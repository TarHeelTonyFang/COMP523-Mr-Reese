{"title": "I actually have two, both about the Pine Valley subdivision, where we have a second home.\n\n\n\n1.  Did they ever arrest the person who murdered the women in Pine Valley about 2-3 months ago?  It seems like the story disappeared from your paper, and the police are quiet about it also.\n\n\n\n2.  Will the parents of the 15 yr old who broke into many houses in the subdivision, mine included, ever be identified?                   Thanks", "text": "  Tom,\nour latest story about the murder says that evidence has been sent to\na lab for analysis and no arrests have been made. Analysis could take\na year. As far as the break-ins, I don't think police would release\nthe names of the parents unless they were somehow charged in the\ncrime. IDing the parents would ID the juvenile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
