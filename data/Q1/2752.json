{"title": "There is a need for some traffic control on Sanders Road in front of Bellamy Elementry School.  There are so many cars at the beginning and end of the school day.  Trying to make a right or left turn is unsafe.  There are also NO flashing school zone lights and some people use these Sanders Road as a cut through from Carolina Beach Road to River Road. How can we get some help in this matter.", "text": "  Here's a link to the answer to your question.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=11725\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
