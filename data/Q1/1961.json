{"title": "Hello, After hearing all the stuff going on in New Hanover ABC, I would like to look into Pender County ABC. I am searching for a web site that you can view the board meetings. Its suppose to be public information however I am having a hard time finding it. Its suppose to be open to employees and the public however I have never heard of anyone being able to attend. Cant find the dates or the times. Whenever I call the Burgaw office they cant seem to tell me when these meeting are. If you cant help please advise me who might be able to help. I am very concerned about the hiring of the new manager in the Hampstead store. I am wondering why the ABC decided to hire someone off the street to manage a public store with no know knowledge of the ABC system, laws and regulations. I\\'d like to know there reasoning for this when they have several qualified employees in the system. Isnt state policy to promote within? Pender county to me seems to be doing everything in secrecy. Please advise me. Thank You. Lisa\n\n  \t ", "text": "  \n\nThis is probably more complicated than I can try to answer here in a\nshort answer. I'm going to pass this along to the team that has been\ncovering ABC issues.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
