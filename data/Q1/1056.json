Has anyone checked the air quality?  A concerned resident.

Wind conditions\nand production activity at the paper mill sometimes combine to allow\nmigration of a distinctive pungent odor familiar to many New Hanover\nCounty residents.\n\n\n\nThe International Paper plant produces paper from pulpwood. The\nprocess involves mixing wood chips with chemicals to produce pulp,\nwhich is then bleached to make paper. It smells, but if not harmful.\nwww.ipaper.com"}
