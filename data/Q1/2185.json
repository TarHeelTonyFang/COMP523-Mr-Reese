{"title": "Why does local law enforcement not enforce traffic laws for bicyclists? In my area of town, groups of 20-30 riders routinely ride through every week, breaking many rules in the process. Riders ride 3-5 wide down the road, do not use designated bike lanes, do not stop at traffic signs, and do not properly signal their turns.
