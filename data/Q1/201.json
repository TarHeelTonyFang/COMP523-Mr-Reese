{"title": "I\\'ve spent a frustrating hour trying to \\'navigate\\' the City of Wilmington internet site. Pages either won\\'t load or load excrutiatingly slowly (I have Roadrunner, which otherwise is fine). And the pages that do load have no phone contact numbers. What is the problem? (I finally gave in and drove to the main  Chestnut Street office to seek my answer.)\n\nVery frustrating.\n\nRonC.", "text": " \nReporter Shelby Sebens contacted city spokeswoman Malissa Talbert as\nsoon as we saw your question. While we didn't hear back from her\nabout he cause of the slowness and difficulty navigating, we did\nnotice the site function improved later in the day. I just checked\nagain and it seems to be functioning as expected. Thanks for using\nMyReporter.com! "}
