{"title": "Can a land developer at Knotts Landing on Sanders Road keep running a noisy pump generator day, night, weekends. The noisy generator is almost in our backyard. We have already ask them to turn off the noisy equipment when they leave work. However, it does no good. Can a county official/officer ask this developer to turn off the noisy pumps that are almost directly in our backyard. The constant grinding, dredging, pulsing loudness very annoying as well as disturbing.", "text": "  \n\n\n\nI\u00cdm sorry you\u00cdre having difficulty resolving this issue, but MyReporter.com doesn\u00cdt handle individual complaints of this nature."}
