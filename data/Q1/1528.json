{"title": "What happens to all of the money taken in by the Taste of Wilmington? I am referring to both the $35 per ticket earnings and the fees charged to the various vendors.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nfrank", "text": "  \n\nAt Taste of Wilmington in 2008, after figuring in the cost of the\nevent -- securing the Coastline, rental equipment, paying a DJ,\nsupplies, ice, etc., etc. etc., plus donating more than $1,000 to the\nnonprofit -- we came out about even. This year the same costs were\nassociated with the event, though on a larger scale. Renting the\nequipment for the Top Chef cookoff, renting the Coastline and paying\nout of pocket for all of the smaller things like ice, plates, coolers,\nflatware, our nonprofit donations, tablecloths, outside lighting,\ntents, and the costs reaches into the thousands and thousands of\ndollars. The fees charges to the various vendors were also only fees\nassociated with advertising each got for either an ad in the StarNews\nor an ad in Wilmington Magazine -- which was actually less than our\nnormal ad rate. In short, while our accounting department has yet to\nfinalize our P&L, the StarNews will retain any leftover profit, in\npart to pay staff for the months and months of work (and overtime on\nweekends) it took to put this festival together.\n\n \n\n\n\nBurke Speaker\n\nEditor, Wilmington Magazine"}
