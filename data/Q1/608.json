{"title": "Some weeks ago I asked this site this question.  The city of Wilmington has been collecting storm water fees from residents for about 5 years.  The money was to be used to fix major drainage problems such as New Center Dr, Racine Dr, etc.  As last week\\'s rains proved nothing has been done.  Is the city building a fund to do this work or is the money going into the general fund?  I never received an acknowledgement or an answer.  Thanks", "text": "  \n\n\n\nI believe this link to a 2009 item at StarNewsOnline.com will answer\nyour question:\nhttp://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20090923/ARTICLES/909229951\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
