{"title": "I have a neighbor that has a 6 x 8 utility shed slightly over our adjoining property lines (it actually sits about a foot onto my property). I only realized this when I was recently trying to refinance my house and the appraiser did a property line survey and brought it to my attention. Without the encroachment being fixed, I can not go forward with my re-finance. I have approached my neighbor and the neighborhood HOA about the situation but nothing has happened to correct the matter. I haven\\'t even gotten a reply. I am sure that New Hanover County must has some restrictions/covenants for property owners that possibly I could refer to. I am thinking that getting New Hanover County involved may be my best remedy. How can I find out what the restrictions are for New Hanover County and how to make a complaint? Thank you for your assistance.", "text": " \nHere's a link to the county's planning and zoning office.
