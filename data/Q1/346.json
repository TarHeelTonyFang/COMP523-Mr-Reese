{"title": "It is 4 am (12-15-11) and a helicopter has been above Wilmington for the past 45 minutes shining its spotlight in random directions upon private property.  The use of the spotlight was obviously not being used for searching or assistance to ground units (if police) judging from height of the aircraft and angle/direction of the spotlight. Was this the police helicopter or was this some random pilot?  Also is there a way to file a complaint for this kind of aircraft behavior or if it was the police, have them justify the use of taxpayer money for an unwelcome light show?  Also, if it was the police, what the heck were they doing?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nCould you give me some cross streets to locate where this took place?\nWithout them it might be difficult to determine which agency was\ninvolved and what was going on. Thanks.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
