I recently had to request information from both Brunswick and New Hanover counties and the paperwork states that they will only release 911 information to parties involved. Are media outlets an exception?\n\n", "text": "  \n\n\n\nI spoke with Lynn Lancaster of the New Hanover County Emergency\nManagement/911 office. Lancaster said individuals and the media can\nrequest tapes of 911 calls under the Freedom of Information Act.\nHowever, tapes provided under FOIA are redacted, meaning names of\npeople making the calls or mentioned in the calls are edited out.\n\n\n\nA subpoena is required to obtain the unredacted tapes, she said.\n\n\n\nI know from our experience that the 911 tapes we've received from\nNew Hanover County have had names edited out.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
