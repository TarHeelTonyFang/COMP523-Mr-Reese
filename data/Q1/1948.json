The Red Cross and other the\norganizations leading the efforts in Haiti most need financial gifts\nin order to best serve the victims. Things like clothes are not\nhelpful right now because there is nowhere to store them, no one to\nsort them, and it would be difficult to transport the items to\nHaiti.\u00ee\n\nHere are places accepting donations:\n\n\n\nTHE HAITI CONNECTION\n\n919-786-4478 or thehaiticonnection.org\n\nTHE SALVATION ARMY\n\n(800) SALARMY, www.salvationarmyusa.com\n\nTHE AMERICAN RED CROSS\n\n(800) REDCROSS or 800-257-7575 (for Spanish) or \n\nwww.redcross.org\n\nN.C.
