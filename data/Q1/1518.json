{"title": "I saw your response on the USS Kitty Hawk.  Isn\\'t the Kitty Hawk at 1046.5 feet too big to go through the current channel in Southport, necessary to get up to Wilmington?  ", "text": "  \n\nApparently, it will fit.\n\nThe length is less of a factor than the draft. \n\nThe Kitty Hawk is 1046 feet long with a draft of about 36 feet,\naccording to the Navy\u00cds stats.  It has a 129-foot beam at the\nwaterline, although the flight deck is about 252 feet wide.\n\nBy comparison, the port routinely handles cargo ships that are around\n965 feet long. The battleship North Carolina is 728 feet long.\n\nThe shipping channel for the Cape Fear River is 44 feet deep and 500\nfeet wide near Southport and 42 feet deep and 400 feet wide in the\nriver, with a 1,200-foot turning basin.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
