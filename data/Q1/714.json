{"title": "I would love to know how to begin a place to find those who attended Chestnut Street School in Mrs. Slocomb\\'s 1st grade class, 1954-55.    We moved away from Wilmington when the Atlantic Coast Line moved to Jacksonville, FL.\n\nI don\\'t know where any of my friends up until 5th grade (we moved in 1960) are now.", "text": "  \n\n\n\nI can think of a couple of options:\n\n\n\n1. Sign up for a Classmates.com account. Lots of people use that pay\nsite to keep in touch with former classmates, teachers and staff.\n\n\n\n2. If you have a Facebook account, you can use it to search for other\nmembers of your class by name or by school.\n\n\n\n3. If you were planning a reunion of those classmates, you could\nsubmit a notice to the StarNews (well in advance) asking for people to\ncontact you.\n\n\n\nDoes that answer your question?\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
