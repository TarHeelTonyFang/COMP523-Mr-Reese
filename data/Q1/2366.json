{"title": "We live across the street from Bellemy Elementary on Saunders Rd.  Over the past 2 years the DOT has attempted to repair a sink hole in front of Bellemy over a dozen times.  Every 2 or 3 weeks four or five trucks and 6 to eight workers show up and they add a huge amount of asphalt but never have they tried to find and fix the root cause of this sink hole.  This is a huge waste of money.  Why not dig it up find out what's undermining the area and be done ONCE?", "text": "  Here's a link to the answer to your question (it's the second half of the story).\n\n\n\nhttp://www.starnewsonline.com/news/20161107/roundabout-work-at-river-and-sanders-roads-delayed-again\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
