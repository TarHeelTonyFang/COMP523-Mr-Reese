{"title": "Why are there so few minorities in the Azalea festival? Wilmington hasn\\'t had an African American queen in years. The Garden Party is predominately a white affair.

Each year I shake my head. I\\'m honestly embarassed!", "text": "  \n\nThis is probably a question for the Azalea Festival Committtee, not\nus. But we do agree with you in the respect that there are many missed\nopportunities to add much-needed diversity to the festival. However,\nthere are more African American belles in recent years and past\nperformers have included ones of color.
