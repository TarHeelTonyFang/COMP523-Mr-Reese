{"title": "Who can I contact for a major light pollution problem on my property? Qn a private street, a developer/real estate agent has installed a street light at my bedroom windows and over the 10' utility easement line onto my private yard.  I was not informed of this installation at all when I purchased my new home.  The  NC Real Estate Commission says that ALL material facts must be disclosed to the buyer.  I closed on Oct 19th - only 60 days later a huge streetlight arrives and digging begins in my private yard.  I have a house on stilts - so imagine how close and BRIGHT the streetlight is to my windows.  Public - take time to read the June 2016 AMA study on the negative effects of LED street lights on human health - a real eye-opener!! I have a major light pollution problem - disrupting my sleep and my children's sleep daily.  since this is a new subdivision and the streets have not been turned over to DOT - who can help me?", "text": "  As the light is on private property and being installed by a private party, your best bet is to consult a lawyer about your options in your specific situation. MyReporter doesn't address individual inquiries of this nature.\n\n\n\n"}
