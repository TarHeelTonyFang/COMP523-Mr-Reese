{"title": "I just saw on WECT news a report regarding why there is no menorah downtown. There was a lighting on Saturday but it was immediately removed and yet the Christmas tree still stands. The council people feel that the Christmas tree just symbolizes winter and snowmen and apparently don\\'t see it as religious. The Christmas tree, aptly named the Christmas tree, is just as religious as a menorah.  I find it offensive that only one religion is celebrated and that so many of our council people were against the menorah remaining downtown and wonder why there is such a lack of support for other religions here in Wilmington. Where can one go or who can one speak with about this because I personally take offense. I also see it as extremely closed minded and anti-semetic and sad that these are the people we have representing our city.
