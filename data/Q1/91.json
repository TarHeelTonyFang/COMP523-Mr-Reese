{"title": "Hi,\n\nWe are locals from Leland NC. I am writing to tell you that my daughter Kaiya Royall, also from Leland, has made it in to the Little Miss NC pageant sponsored by National American Miss,held in Winston Salem this year. I am so very proud of her. She is a very smart girl. She enjoys reading, singing, dancing, and hanging out with her family. I would really like to get a something nice in the newspaper about her. Do you think that this is possible?\n\n\n\nThanks, a very proud mother,\n\n\n\nTanya Royall", "text": " \n\n\n\nYour information has been forwarded to the local news editor in charge of community coverage.
