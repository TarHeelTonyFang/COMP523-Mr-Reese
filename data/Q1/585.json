{"title": "Is there a source that gives information about organizations that provide aid to those in need that is updated periodically? Wrighsville Beach magazine provides some of this information on their website and has also included a supplement in one of their previous issues. This area needs a source of information for those who suddenly find themselves homeless and need to know what services are available to help them. Such a source would also benefit volunteers looking for ways to help those less fortunate in our community.\n\nThe source could also be expanded to help those who have been diagnosed with a disease and are searching for organizations that can provide assistance.\n\nIf this source could be placed online, it could be updated frequently to keep it current. The source could also be printed as a supplement at times in the StarNews.\n\nA fascinating story or series for the StarNews would be to follow a person or family that suddenly becomes homeless in Wilmington. The story could describe the person or family\\'s efforts to find assistance in our community and the help that is found.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nJohn\n\n", "text": "  \n\n\n\nHi, John.
