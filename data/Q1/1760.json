How are we preparing our students for college when they don\\'t have textbooks they can take home and read. I feel this is truly a disservice to our children. I am being told it is a budget issue but I feel that is not accurate. ", "text": "  \n\nOur education reporter has been told the same. We'll look into it\nand if there's more information we can get, we'll post a story in\nStarNews and StarNewsOnline.com. Thanks for your concern about our\nchildren's education and the news tip."}
