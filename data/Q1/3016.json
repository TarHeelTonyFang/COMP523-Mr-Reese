{"title": "Why is the Christmas parade now called The Holiday Parade?  It was called The Christmas Parade for many, many years because I used to attend and was even in the parade one year.\n\n\n\nIt disturbs me that everything is becoming so politically correct that you can\\'t even say Christmas anymore.  I and many of my friends & neighbors have stopped coming just because of that.  WILMINGTON...IT IS THE CHRISTMAS PARADE!", "text": "  The\nWilmington Holiday Parade sponsored by the city parks and recreation\ndepartment began seven years ago and is the first parade sponsored by\nthe city, at least in modern times. There were some privately\norganized parades off and on in the past, but the city event didn't\nbegin until 2003.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
