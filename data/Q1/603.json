{"title": "What are the laws governing parking on the street in a neighborhood. I would like to know how to look this up. Here is the problem---White Road is very busy but there people who park their entire car in the street in a curve and the traffic has to funnel into one lane--is this legal. People also park on the wrong side of the street facing on-coming traffic so at night it looks like a car is coming at you without the lights on. Thank you for your help in advance.
