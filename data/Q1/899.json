{"title": "Your answer about traffic light at Enterprise Drive and U.S. 74/76 in Leland is, I\\'ll put it, not much of an answer. There is a regional park nearby requiring a u-turn for West bound traffic. Also: Brunswick Community College Campus, two 18 wheeler transfer facilities, more than a half dozen industrial manufacturing plants with huge parking lots for employees, a power transfer station with repair trucks, EMT Station, and a large housing development. Further West on 74/76 there are traffic lights for a fraction of the traffic. \n\nDoes there have to be a big accident before traffic control is addressed or is this political?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nMichael,\n\n\n\nWould you mind posting this as a comment to the MyReporter answer?\nThat way others can see it and also comment on it.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
