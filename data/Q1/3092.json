{"title": "On Monday, a large ship that looked like a small cruise ship was docked near PPD. On Tuesday AM, it was gone. Why was the ship docked there?", "text": " Port City Marina is on the river behind PPD and large private yachts moored there can attract attention from both locals and visitors. We can't inquire about who owns each of them but know that they can rent for upwards of $100,000 a week."}
