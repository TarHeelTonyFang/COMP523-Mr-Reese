{"title": "Frequently (or occasionally) I see what I think are USAF executive transport aircraft painted in the executive transport color scheme - apparently practicing touch and go landings at ILM. What are they actually doing and why are they doing it in the skies over Wilmington (and likely on the runways at ILM)?\n\n\n\nMy wild guess is they may be VC-32 (military designation) aircraft/Boeing model 757-200 (civil designation) and might be practicing touch and go landings at ILM.\n\n\n\nOne reason I\\'m wondering is I\\'ve had people mention to me that it\\'s Air Force One and it (or they) are practicing touch an goes at ILM.\n\n\n\nAlthough any Air Force airplane would be designated AF-1 if POTUS were aboard, the aircraft that is, for the most part, Air Force One is a Boeing Model 747 (VC-25) and this is clearly NOT the airplane that is frequently seen above the skies of Wilmington. The only Air Force executive transport aircraft I\\'ve personally seen are all twin engine jets and, of course, the 747/VC-25 is a four engine jet.\n\n\n\nOther possibilities, in addition to the 757/VC-32 include 737/VC-40.\n\n\n\nI hope my question is clear enough and you will be able to give me the answer.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nWayne Killian\n\n", "text": "  \n\nWe posted this answer yesterday and it's the most thorough answer\nwe've gotten to date from the airport.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=3436"}
