{"title": "My child\\'s school bus stops to unload at a 4-way stop intersection within my neighborhood. This afternoon, while the bus was unloading, I witnessed a vehicle coming from the opposite direction, stop at the stop sign but then proceed to turn left in front of the schools bus, almost running down children. How is the school bus passing law interpreted in a case like this?", "text": "  \n\nIn this case, from what you've described, it appears the driver\nviolated common sense -- and the law. We can't find any such specific\nclause, but if this kind of case went to court, we're certain the\njudge would say this violated the law -- and anyone with half a brain\nwould likely agree."}
