{"title": "Why are there so many new homes being built when there are so many homes on the market forclosers, bank owend and still thay keep building? Seams like all of wilmington is forsale.", "text": "  \n\nBecause developers need to make money, and they do that by developing\nnew properties and building new homes. When the housing market\ncrashed, most of the sales stopped, but even though some developments\nare on hold, some are still in the process of building, and that's\nwhat you're seeing. In effect, developers are banking on new homes\nsales to increase. And so they'll keep building new homes if they see\na market for that."}
