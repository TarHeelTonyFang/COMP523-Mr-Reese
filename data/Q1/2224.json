{"title": "What is the problem with the traffic signals in Wilmington. Because I travel around the SE US, I\\'ve noticed that the traffic signals here in Wilmington are phased and timed differently than in other areas. For example, the other day I waited nearly 5 minutes for the signal to change at Station Rd and Military Cut-off even though there was no traffic on Military in either direction.(I was attempting to turn left from Station Rd onto Military) In most areas, since no traffic was coming, the signal would have gone to green after detecting my vehicle, allowing me to turn left, and then back to red. It seems to me that traffic flow in Wilmington would be greatly enhanced with better phasing and timing of the traffic signals. Thank you.", "text": "  Here are a couple of links:\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=4700\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=4212\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
