{"title": "I live in Ivanhoe which is in 3 different counties (Bladen, Pender and Sampson) we live in Bladen the zip code for Ivanhoe is: 28447.  Dish network allows us to pay $5 per month to receive local Wilmington stations.  Direct TV has free local stations but says we are in the Raleigh area market.  We are only 40 minutes to Wilmington and over 1.5 hours to Raleigh.  They say we can\\'t get Wilmington as our market.  I have checked with others and have been told that Pender and Bladen counties are in the Wilmington market.  What can we do to get them to give us Wilmington stations?", "text": "  \n\nFor this question we're sorry but you'll need to direct that\nquestion to your provider. We cannot do anything to help in this\nprivate matter."}
