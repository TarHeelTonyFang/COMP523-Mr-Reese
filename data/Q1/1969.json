{"title": "As the parent of a child in the NHC school system, I am extremely disappointed in the way our school board handled the resent middle school redistricting.  Comments made by Ed Higgins regarding the last minute changes to the final map (which resulted in an increase in free and reduced lunch rate for the new school in Castle Hayne) proved that his thinking is so far outdated as to render him unqualified to perform adequately in the position he now holds.  As a result, in the upcoming election I intend to not only vote against any incumbent who voted for the current redistricting map (along with its backdoor politically motivated changes) but also campaign aggressively for anyone running against them.  Have any potential candidates come forward to run against Higgins, Cavenaugh and Hayes?  I\u00e4\u00f3\u00bbll have to wait until the 2012 elections to vote against Nichols.", "text": "  \n\nThis isn't really a question; it's an opinion.
