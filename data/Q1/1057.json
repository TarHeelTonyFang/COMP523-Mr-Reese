{"title": "What\\'s the status of the project to realign the intersection of Masonboro Loop, Pine Grove and Masonboro Sound Loop roads?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Wilmington annexed the Masonboro area the NC DOT was in the process of realigning the intersection of Masonboro Loop, Pine Grove and Masonboro Sound Loop Roads.  Since then nothing has happened except the intersection had become more crowed and waits of 10 to 15 minutes are not uncommon at this intersection. For those who have paid 10s of thousands in property taxes to the city, we think we deserve better service from the city. When will this bottle neck be fixed?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nThe design is just about complete, and the city is waiting on an N.C.\nDepartment of Transporation permit only, said Richard King, city\nPublic Services director. After that, the bidding process will begin.\nKing said he anticipates construction to begin at the end of this year\nor in early 2010.\n\nThe project has been delayed in part due to a shortage in staff in\nthe city\u00cds engineering department, he said.\n\nThe project includes drainage improvements at that intersection.\nPlus, when complete, traffic on Pine Grove Drive will continue onto\nMasonboro Loop Road, with no stop sign. Masonboro Loop Road traffic,\nsimilarly, will be able to continue onto Pine Grove without a stop. \nMasonboro Sound traffic instead will get the stop sign under the new\nconfiguration.\n\nKing said the project would cost about $300,000, with most of the\nfunding from the DOT."}
