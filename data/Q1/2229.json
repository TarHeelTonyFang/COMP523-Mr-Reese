{"title": "Delaware Nixon (wife Julia Loftin) was the first Aftrican-American County Commissioner (1874-1877) in Wilmington, NC.  His son Jordan was the 2nd.  Delaware was a great ++++ grandfather of mine.  I\\'d always heard the story that either he or his son was murdered during the racial riots there.  I can\\'t find much information about either of the men.  Could you tell me if anything I mentioned is true and whether Delaware Nixon was a former slave?  Who was his slave owner? Anything would be of help?", "text": "  Here are links to information that should answer parts of your\nquestion.\n\n\n\nBiographies of New Hanover County commissioners:\nhttp://www.nhcgov.com/Library/Documents/NHC%20Commissioners.pdf\n\n\n\nThe 1898 page at StarNewsOnline.com:\nhttp://www.starnewsonline.com/section/topic37\n\n\n\nWilmington Race Riot Commission report:\nhttp://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/default.htm\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
