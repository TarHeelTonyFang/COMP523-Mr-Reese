{"title": "Why are unlicensed mopeds than legally cannot go faster that 30mph, be allowed to travel, and restrict traffic, on roads with posted speed limits of 45mph?\n\nThere really is something wrong, and dangerous, with this situation.\n\nThanx for investigating.\n\n\n\nMike", "text": "  \n\nNorth Carolina law defines mopeds as having engines with less than\n50-cubic-centimeter piston displacement and top speeds not exceeding\n30 mph on a level surface. Moped drivers don\u00cdt need a license,\ninsurance or registration, and they must be 16, wear a motorcycle\nhelmet and follow the rules of the road.\n\n\n\nScooter drivers traveling faster than 30 mph are considered to be\nriding a motorcycle and face tougher state requirements. They must\nhave a special North Carolina driver\u00cds license, endorsed for\nmotorcycles, and they must register their vehicles and have\ninsurance.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
