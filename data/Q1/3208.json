{"title": "Any word yet from the NCDOT if funding has been acquired for the installation of the stoplight at Market Street and Green Meadows Drive and when will it be operational?  (It seems the DOT is dragging their feet about getting this light installed.  This is one of the most dangerous intersections in the city with all the Dutch Square industrial traffic trying to make turns into the center lane of Market.  Why is it taking so long since the signal was approved last year?)", "text": "Four months ago we wrote that there was no funding source for that\nproject.\n\nhttp://www.myreporter.com/?p=15485\n\nLet's let a year go by and see if DOT's coffers have gotten fatter."}
