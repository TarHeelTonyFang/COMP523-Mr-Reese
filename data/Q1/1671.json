{"title": "Re:  Rollins\\' BBQ\n\n\n\nPlease allow me to jump in here and talk about my grandfather\\'s fantastic BBQ resturant.  My Dad, of Port City Sign Company, painted the signs on the place.  Sonny Rollins, another of Pop\\'s grandchildren worked there frequently as a car hop.  I delivered the Sunday paper to Pop and was always rewarded with the best pancake breakfast.  Of course, this was all during the mid-fifties.  I frequently went to the pit located behind the place and did a little \\'pig-pickin\\' and that was the best!  I\\'ve never had Brunswick stew as good as what he and my grandmother made and I\\'ve tried a lot since moving to Richmond.  Some of you might remember Johnnie \\'Skipper\\' Reams who was also a car hop and is still a friend.  There exists a great hi-res 8 x 10 photo of the place taken by Wilmington photographer John Kelly and if I can locate a copy in the very near future, I\\'ll submit it.\n\nThanks to everyone for their memories!\n\nBobby Barefoot", "text": "  \n\nIf you like, you can click on the comments section at the end of the\npost about Rollins BBQ and add this to them.
