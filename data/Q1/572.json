{"title": "I see an american flag in the marsh edge of the east bank of the Brunswick River beside bridge coming out of Leland. Is this the spot of the WW II crash site of the plane that is rumored to have crashed there. What happened to the crew?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nHere's the response from reporter Amy Hotz:\n\n\n\nI simply can\u00cdt find anyone who knows anything about this flag. I\ntalked to Bev Tetterton and Ann Pennington (local WWII aviation\nhistorian) and they have never heard of a plane going down in the\nBruns. River.\n\n\n\nI talked to Belville and Leland town halls, as well as the Army Corps\nof Engineers which patrols that area a lot, and they couldn\u00cdt find\nanyone who knew anything about it.\n\n\n\nMy guess is, someone had a flag and stuck it there. Call it a random\nact of patriotism.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
