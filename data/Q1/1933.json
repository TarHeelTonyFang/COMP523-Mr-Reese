{"title": "I would prefer to remain anonymous in regards to this question. With all the noise about the swine flu this year, why isn\\'t New Hanover Correctional Center doing more to prevent an outbreak? Signs have been posted about the correct way to wash your hands, but no soap or paper towles are being made available in the inmate bathrooms, and janitors aren\\'t permitted to use any bleach in cleaning the dorms or bathrooms.", "text": "  \n\nThey say they're doing what they can while following the regulations\nof the correctional center. Our reporter Vicky Eckenrode is looking\ninto it more to see if there's a story there. We'll run it online\nand in the StarNews if there is. Thanks,"}
