{"title": "During Hurricane Irene, I was amazed at the total lack of information on the hurricane itself on local radio. Our power was out and I could not access tv stations. I had an old radio and went up and down the FM and AM bands and only when I found 980 the WAVE on Saturday morning did I get any updates on what was open, what was closed, where to get food, etc... And the original program was meant to be a Swap Shop, but the DJ very smartly turned it into an information sharing program. What stations offer a similar service on radio in the event of another storm? And realize, a crawl on a tv does no good if you have no tv service.
