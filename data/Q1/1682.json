{"title": "why does Wilmington and new Hanover county have two seperate police departments? It is a small county, and a large town, would it not make better financial sense to put it all under one umbrella??", "text": "  \n\nIt depends on state funds and how the city was incorporated. In this\ncase, the county also covers the county -- which the city does not. It\nalso may not make financial sense, as state funds often do not match\ncity funds."}
