{"title": "I\\'m going to a concert at Battleship Memorial Park and was wondering if you can bring coolers into the park.What are the park rules for events?", "text": "  \n\nSometimes you can, sometimes you can't. It depends on the event, and\nwhat they allow. We hate to give you such a vague answer. The event\nitself should provide details about pets, coolers, etc. Or, at the\nvery least, a contact number with more information."}
