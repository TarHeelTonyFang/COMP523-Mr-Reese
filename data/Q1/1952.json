{"title": "What are the city\\'s thoughts about repaving Front Street to make it a pedestrian only walkway with  limited vehicle access for deliveries etc at specific times such as they have in Burlington, Vermont and Boulder, Colorado. This seems to provide more pedestrian traffic, open areas for cart vendors and a common place for people to gather. It seems we have the weather to do it if places like Vermont and Colorado are able to. We have ample parking with the parking decks etc that it may not be a bad idea.

If you'd like to direct your suggestion to the\ncity, here's a link to the city's web site with more information:\n\nhttp://www.wilmingtonnc.gov/public_services/construction_projects/capital_projects/front_street_project.aspx\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
