{"title": "A roundabout is scheduled to be built in the near future at the intersection of Porters Neck Road and Edgewater Club Road because of increased traffic in the area.  I am one of many people who commute and travel Porters Neck Road every day and am concerned about the disruption to traffic during what will be weeks of roundabout construction.  Would installation of a traffic light at this intersection be faster and more economical as well as safer?  Also, who should I contact to request that a traffic light be considered as much better option?", "text": "  You\ncan contact the local DOT at this site:\n\nhttp://www.ncdot.gov/doh/operations/division3/\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
