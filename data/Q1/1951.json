{"title": "All right enough ABC talk...You keep writing about this issue weekly, but always say the same thing..Can somebody please tell me (the public)..what does the ABC Board do?? What kind of tax revenue does the State need to privatize the sale of alcoholic beverages? If they were sold in grocery and drug stores do you think those stores would need a committee (see ABC board) to price and warehouse the goods?? When is someone of intelligence going to put forth a privatization proposal whereby the State would not lose revenue (maybe even gain some) and the cost of alcohol would go down to the consumer. How about the Star News reporters following up on this subject....The Legislature is of no help.\n\nHow about a committe of Grocers, Druggists etc coming up with something.", "text": "  \n\nThis is more of a comment than a question.
