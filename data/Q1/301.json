{"title": "Hi,  About a week ago, I sent a question to  My Reporter concerning the cost of repairs and liability about the sewer project on Rose Ave and roadworks at Wrightsville and Independence. It has been my good experience in the past that you alerted the author of the question as to the publish date of the response. As I have yet to receive any alerts about an answer, I was a little stunned by Ken Little\\'s article which has appeared in the online edition of your newspaper(10-12-2010). Can you explain this action? Can you explain the lack of reference to your dedicated readers who observe these situations all over the city and county and then alert you to the observations? This type of behavior will lose readers and decrease the amount of questions asked of the paper. \n\nThanx,  Brian Keever", "text": "  \n\n\n\nBrian,\n\nI apologize. It is my practice to send links to answers or stories\nresulting from questions by readers. While I am directly responsible\nfor MyReporter answers, stories resulting from questions are usually\nhandled by other editors. Somehow I overlooked this story and didn't\nsend a link to you. Thanks for calling it to my attention. We do\nappreciate your involvement with MyReporter. I hope you continue to\nsubmit questions. Again, please accept my apology.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
