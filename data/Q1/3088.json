{"title": "I was promised by the Star News 3 times that I would receive a paper on Thanksgiving Day, but, though I called while the office was open TWICE, I still have not received a paper.  \n\n\n\nWhy was I promised a paper?  What happened to my paper?  Why would the Star News promise me one and then not deliver it?  \n\n\n\nSeriously, is this what you consider customer service?  I could understand if I had only called once, but calling once early in the week and then twice on Thursday should have gotten me a paper.  \n\n\n\nI would appreciate an answer as to why the Star News failed so miserably in the simple task of delivering a paper to me.\n\n\n\nThank you.", "text": "  Your\ncomplaint has been forwarded to the person in charge of newspaper\ndelivery.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
