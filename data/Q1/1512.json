{"title": "I read in yesterday\\'s NY Times about the Conficker virus million or more attacks on computers. One scam mentioned told of a notification of a virus in an individual\\'s computer and people are instructed to download a cure for a price. A week or so ago such a menu popped up on my monitor when I was on your website. I figured it was a trick and The only way I could get rid of it was to shut down by pulling the plug. Does this mean your site has been invaded by Conficker? ", "text": "  \n\nAfter a thorough check with our web hosting source, it's clear there\nhas been no virus attached to the site. However, as I'm sure you\nalready know, if you don't click on those pop-up ads, you won't get\nany virus attached to them. Thanks for inquiring!"}
