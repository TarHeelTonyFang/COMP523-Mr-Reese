{"title": "I am looking for the recipe for brown dog candy.while growing up my family would buy it from a black gentlemen who worked at the Ideal Laundry with my uncle and later from a lady I worked with. Neither person would share the recipe.  I bought some recently at the Eagle Island produce.  When I  google it all I can find that is even close is brown sugar candy and it is not the same thing. I think it has African American origins but am not certain.  I am almost positive it is a southern thing.  It is made with raw peanuts and some sort of sugar/brown sugar mixture.  The kind I have found and had as a child was in the shape of a circle and supposedly was made in lids of mason jars. I really would love to make my own.  I have searched quite a bit and have not found anything.  If you have or can find this recipe I would be so grateful.  Thanks for your help.

Maybe if you asked in person?\n\n\n\nI did find this answer on another question site:\nhttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070615154242AABznim\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
