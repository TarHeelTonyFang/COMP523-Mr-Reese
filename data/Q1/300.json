{"title": "How does the My Reporter staff determine which submitted questions get answered and published?  Thanx, Brian", "text": "  \n\n\n\nBrian,\n\n\n\nWe try to answer every legitimate question we receive. Some questions\nhave already been answered and those answers published, so we just\nreply to the questioner with a link to the answer. Other questions\nwere answered in recent stories at StarNewsOnline.com. Again, we reply\nwith a link to the story. The rest of the questions are assigned to\nreporters who try to get the answers within five business days. There\nare factors that can cause answers to be delayed, such as\nuncooperative sources, schedule conflicts, breaking news and holidays.\nSince MyReporter began in 2009, we've answered more than 1,800\nquestions on the site.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
