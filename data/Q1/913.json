Is there no way to track this?", "text": "  \n\n\n\nN.C. DMV does track expired license plates and issues renewal notices\nto vehicle owners. And police do issue citations for expired tags,\nthough the process relies on random encounters. Like you, I, too,\nwould be caught after the first day. Others have more luck.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
