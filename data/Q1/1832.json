{"title": "Why only three airlines at Wilmington Airport (ILM)?", "text": "  \n\nThe airlines are based on amount of traffic and if those flights will\nbe able to be filled on a daily basis. What happens is that if an\nairline has interest, but its routes will not be heavily used, the\nairline won't fly out of that airport. But, the airline is always\nlooking at adding more routes and -- if possible -- new airlines."}
