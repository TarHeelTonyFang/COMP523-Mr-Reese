{"title": "Why are people that have lost their driving privileges (license) allowed to drive motor bikes/mopeds on the roads without a license or insurance, or an inspected motorized vehicle?  And how does this make any sense?  At least make them have an insured, inspected, and license tagged motorized vehicle.  Wouldn\\'t that add some funds into the system?\n\nAdditionally - they are an awful hazard to automobile traffic.\n\nAlso, how are they allowed to drive over 35mph without a license plate - that is unlawful according to the DMV.\n\nThanx for your help.\n\nMike", "text": "  \n\n\n\nHere some links to previous posts on this topic.
