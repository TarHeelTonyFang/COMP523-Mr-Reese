{"title": "Who do I call when my neighbor\\'s children are totally out of control?  There are at least 5 aged 4 to 17 that have no adult supervision and are destructive.  The oldest one just got suspended from school and the bus does not stop here anymore.  The mother is gone, but she is associated with the police.  I have tried talking with the father, but he just tells me to call the cops.  I have been vandalized by them on numerous occasions, the cops are there all the time, but nothing is ever done.  They think they control the neighborhood and I think they do.  Every ten minutes there is another vehicle.  My windows rattle from the noise.  I live in such a beautiful area, but they are ruining it.  They happen to live right across the street from me and my other neighbors don\\'t seem to care.  Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!
