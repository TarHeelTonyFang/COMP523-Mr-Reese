Are any other cell phone companies improving towers/coverage in this area?", "text": "  \n\nWe do know that each cell phone carrier continues to improve their\ncell service in more remote areas. Verizon has said recently it's\nworking in this area to improve cell service. As for towers, no new\nones at this time, but that could change by the day, week or month."}
